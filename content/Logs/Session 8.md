> [!info] Thursday around midday.

[[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] is left alone in [[Jeff's Lab]] to tinker with one set of [Sending Stones](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sending-stones), and is given half of another set to communicate and a javelin to defend himself if needed. [[Marius]] alarms the only entrance to the lab.

#MafiaStuff Before leaving, [[Marius]] hands the letter to [[Falsair]] for safekeeping.

#BootlegBargains The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] then returns to [[Barouk's Works]] to get paid. Thinking about the auction job on the way, [[Marius]] and [[Falsair]] both recall going to Black Market auctions before, where one can purchase lots of "alternatively acquired" art, high-end equipment, magic items, exotic mounts and pets, slaves and other goods. Very high-end stuff. When [[Falsair]] enjoyed good standing among [[Ondra]]'s villains he would have had an automatic invitation, as would  [[Marius]] when he was considered part of the [[Bode Family]]. Everyone else would have had written invitations, or would have been sponsored by other villainous organizations. [[Falsair]] thinks that they have been assigned that job because [[Beep Boop]] wants whatever is being auctioned.

#MafiaStuff [[Marius]] says that, given the letter, the Black Market would be a dangerous place for himself and [[Falsair]]. [[Lachlan]] suggests putting it off until the date is closer, as acquiring an invitation would require lots of work.

On the way to [[Barouk's Works]], [[Gwyn]] asks [[Chicken]] to fly over them and keep an eye, but he is more focused on impressing the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] with some tricks and doesn't notice anything. They leave [[Chicken]] circling the air outside the building while the rest go in and find [[Issha]]. [[Marius]] asks him to clarify whether [[Lachlan]] is being paid for his work, but [[Issha]] refuses as they are unwilling to let him speak to [[Lachlan]] alone. They also convince [[Issha]] that [[Gwyn]] is actually [[Meldohr]].

#BeigeStalkers [[Issha]] agrees to pay the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] 133 gold pieces after seeing [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]]'s signature, showing that he is happy with the job and is now in a safe place. However, he refuses to pay for [[Miss Lucy]] since there is no proof that the cats were located.

#MissingHeroes #EvilBoop [[Nula]] also asks [[Issha]] about [[Ensari]], and he says that he hasn't seen her in a few days and that she left him in charge on [[Barouk's Works]] until she returns, but she never told him where she was going. When he says that he has been working non stop, [[Marius]] suggests that it would be somewhat robotic if he wasn't stopping to eat and rest, but he doesn't react to this.

#EvilBoop While [[Issha]] is fetching the money, [[Gwyn]] looks through his desk, but he didn't leave much. His notepad is there, full of lists where he is ticking off things to do. He notices that his writing has changed over time to a perfect font, that of a construct. The most recent items are "send out new jobs", "wait for the team", and "pay the team". There is also a ledger where workers sign in and out. [[Karen]] signed in two days ago but never signed out, and [[Jenny]] signed in on Wednesday and signed out at the end of the day. [[Jonathan]], or John, the cleaner, is also signed in.

While [[Issha]] is still away, [[Falsair]] and [[Gwyn]] leave to try to find one of [[Falsair]]'s dead cats. They stumble upon [[Jonathan]], who tells them that [[Maisie]], another cleaner, found the cat and put it in the bin out back.

Before they return, [[Issha]] comes back and asks where [[Falsair]] and [[Gwyn]] are. [[Gal]] tries to distract him, telling him off for having a desk too tall for gnomes and halflings. [[Issha]] then hands her a pouch of gold, and soon after [[Falsair]] and [[Gwyn]] appear and they all leave the building.

Before moving on, they check the bin behind the building. [[Lachlan]] finds the burnt remains of the cat, which [[Falsair]] is able to bring back as a zombie. They also find some paperwork that has been cross-shredded, but they leave it as it would be almost impossible to reconstruct. There, they also split the money, and decide to give [[Meldohr]]'s share to [[Allia]]'s temple. [[Lachlan]] gets 3 gold.

#FishAndChips The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] travels to the docks. They can see ships docked along the river and metal containers and boxes being moved around. [[Lachlan]] approaches one of the dock workers and offers to help moving crates. Initially, [[Gal]] tells the worker off for trying to take advantage of the lad, but then decides to question him while [[Lachlan]] does his work. The worker is called [[Darren]]. 

[[Darren]] says that it is not unusual for people to not show up to work because it is shit, and he doesn't believe the talk about workers being abducted. He tells [[Gal]] that the person to talk to would be [[Andrew]], who is probably lazing around at a pub somewhere. He also mentions [[Wesley]], who is apparently crazy and has been talking about birds and fish things. [[Wesley]] is working a few ships away.

[[Gal]] offers him a business card and [[Falsair]] asks him what he can do, but when [[Gal]] mentions his family and his ~~probably dead~~ wife he becomes quite rude. His whole family had died in a fire and he was not happy that he was being asked about it. He insults [[Falsair]]'s cat but the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]], with some difficulty, moves on to talk to [[Wesley]].

They find [[Wesley]] moving boxes from a ship to a warehouse. He is scrawny and twitching. When they approach him, he hands his box to [[Lachlan]], who starts hauling items to the warehouse for him. [[Marius]] asks him about the monster that he has been talking about, and he says that it comes from the river and has been snatching lone workers. When [[Marius]] asks about the birds, he says that he doesn't trust things that can fly. [[Lachlan]] points out the drake, and [[Wesley]] takes some time to compare [[Gwyn]]'s relationship to [[Chicken]] to slavery.

[[Nula]] reads his surface thoughts, which are crazy ramblings about fish people coming to get him. His deeper thoughts are just another insane monologue. [[Marius]] asks for more details of the river creature, and he tells him that it is blue and like a long and big fish. He says that it appears at all times of day, but only when someone is on their own. 

[[Gal]] suggests hiding somewhere, and [[Wesley]] offers a fishing rod, which he does not have but is willing to steal and resell. He also mentions his boss, [[David]].

By the water, [[Lachlan]] uses [Commune with Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/commune-with-nature). The river is murky, but as he dips his hand in the water it starts to clear, and he becomes a fish flowing down the river. As he gets further away from their position, the river is almost blocked out, as if there is something constructed there that is blocking his senses. Then, he flows beyond the obstruction, now knowing that there is an underwater structure by the river bank. After he reveals this information, they try to leave [[Wesley]] behind to investigate, but [[Nula]] notices that he is following. [[Marius]] tries making some noise on the water to scare him away, but it doesn't work and they decide to allow him to follow in case he is able to warn them of any danger from the water.

By the obstruction, [[Nula]] summons the [[Octotank]], and [[Lachlan]] casts [Beast Sense](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:beast-sense) to see through its eyes. It goes underwater to have a look at the structure along the bank. It finds it 40 or 50 feet deep. It is a large, metal door, with somewhat intricate designs on it but no handles. It shows no signs of decay or corrosion, and there are no visible openings around it.

Once they finish looking underwater, [[Gal]] asks another worker about weird activity in the river and the warehouse on top of where the tunnel would lead. He states that he hasn't seen anything weird in or around the warehouse, they just move boxes in and out. [[Falsair]] then tries to convince him that [[David]] has told them that everyone should take the rest of the day off, but he doesn't believe it and asks [[Lachlan]] to lug crates for him.

Knowing what is underwater, the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] decides to offer the workers money to leave for a while so they can lure the creature out. Once the area is empty, [[Gwyn]] camouflages himself against a box, and [[Lachlan]] pretends to keep carrying boxes while everyone else hides. [[Nula]] can still see [[Wesley]] hiding behind a box. As she is looking around, she notices someone lying down on top of a crate near [[Wesley]]. He has an arrow primed, the head of it shining with poison. 

As the figure notices [[Nula]] watching, he releases the arrow, just as she yells out a warning. She is hit and is poisoned by the arrow. [[Gal]] immediately uses [Mirror Image](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mirror-image) to create three copies of herself. She is looking around, but can't spot anyone.

Then, a whistling [Sea Elf](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:sea-elf) walks into view from the opposite side of the warehouse, carrying a rapier and swirling with cold, arcane energy. he is [bladesinging](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wizard:bladesinging). The damage that his cold energy inflicts causes [[Nula]] to drop concentration and the [[Octotank]] vanishes.

Another blade singer emerges from the mass of crates, and manages to take [[Gal]] down. [[Lachlan]] starts raging and punches one of the blue elves, almost killing him with one blow.

A second hidden elf shoots [[Marius]], knocking him prone and soon after he goes unconscious, while [[Nula]] is able to heal [[Gal]].

During the following battle, the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] along with [[Chicken]] are able to eliminate two of the elves, and [[Lachlan]] leaves a third one unconscious for interrogation. However, he has been poisoned and falls to the ground incapacitated.

><font color="grey">GAL:</font> Looks like fish is back on the menu!

Watching the remaining blade singer readying himself over [[Marius]]'s unconscious form, [[Gwyn]] tries to take him down with his bow. He shoots twice, but both times the elf is able to dodge his arrows. Unable to shoot again, [[Gwyn]] makes a split second decision to use [[Chicken]]'s [Drake Breath](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/ranger:drakewarden) to administer the coup de grâce, disregarding the risk of hitting [[Marius]] and [[Lachlan]] at the elf's feet...
