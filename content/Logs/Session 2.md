The session starts in the room at the end of the secret tunnel in [[Fenny's Home]]. Two of the small [[Burning Cats]] lie on the ground, no longer in flames, while the remaining two are still engaging the [[index#Players|party]]. A large creature, formed from what appears to be another 22 dead cats, is now present in the room and ready to attack. It is winged and appears to be some sort of [[Dead Cat Dragon]].

[[Evan]], still in his [[Beep Boop]] form, attempts unsuccessfully to attract the creature's attention, while [[Gal|Gal]] is still near the man on the hospital bed at the end of the room.

During combat, [[Falsair]] uses [Dimension Door](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dimension-door) to teleport next to [[Gal|Gal]], leaving [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] to face the [[Dead Cat Dragon|Dragon]]. Soon after, [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] is bitten and goes down.

Observing the [[Dead Cat Dragon|Dragon]], [[Falsair]] identifies that the different smaller cats making up this creature are Undead and being held together by some sort of Wild Shape magic.

Meanwhile, the figure on the bed is begging [[Gal|Gal]] to be put out of his misery. When she severs the tubes connecting him to the vats surrounding the bed he screams in pain and both the blue liquid and his blood start leaking out and forming a puddle on the floor. Shortly after she is taken down by the [[Dead Cat Dragon|Dragon]] and is later brought back by [[Falsair]], while [[Marius]] helps [[Meldohr|Meldohr]].

During combat [[Nula]] conjures a Giant Octopus to grapple the [[Dead Cat Dragon|Dragon]], and [[Evan]] takes it down by shooting it between the eyes with an arrow. One of the [[Burning Cats]] is still alive, and [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] manages to tie it up. [[Nula]] tries to pour water on it so it can be put in a bag without burning it up, but this kills it.

Once out of combat, [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] tries to examines the man's body and figures out that the blue chemical is being used to force magic inside of him while the blood is being removed to use this magic outside of his body.

[[Nula]] identifies this man as [[Fengar]], a druid who can Wild Shape into a Saber-Toothed Tiger and who is known to be in the same Superhero team as [[Beep Boop]]. The party realises that the cat-adjacent fur upstairs is probably Tiger fur and [[Gal|Gal]] notes that "[[Fenny]]"" is probably [[Fengar]].

[[Gal|Gal]] checks the panels near the chemical vats and notices that the lights have all gone off. She makes a sketch of the panel. Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the room, [[Evan]], [[Nula]] and [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] try to pull down the [[Beep Boop]] portraits. They are only able to pull one down, ripping out the wires connected behind it. [[Nula]] notices that the portrait's eyes are no longer lit up with red light.

She then asks the Giant Octopus that she had conjured during the fight to drink some of the chemicals on the floor. It seems to adopt [[Nula]]'s Star Form. [[Gal|Gal]] also collects a small amount of the liquid.

[[Falsair]] uses his necromantic abilities to bring [[Miss Lucy]]'s cats back. He asks the prettiest one of them to drink up the chemicals, which turns into a shape similar to a Saber-Toothed Tiger and becomes hostile. It is easily killed by [[Falsair]]'s other cats, but during the fight the chemicals on the floor are set alight, causing half of the room to be on fire.

[[Meldohr|Meldohr]] tries to retrieve [[Fengar]]'s body but decides not to step into the flames. 

The party then returns to the house through the tunnel, trying not to trigger the tripwires. [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] snags one with his hammer but manages to get through. [[Marius]] also sets a mental alarm on the lab entrance before crossing. The last of [[Falsair]]'s cats to cross triggers one of the wires with its tail, however nothing happens.

Once outside of the tunnel, inside [[Fenny's Home]], [[Evan]] checks the back door while [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] attempts to discreetly check outside through the upstairs window and fails miserably. He does spot three men at the door wearing blue uniforms, which [[Falsair]] identifies as police uniforms.

[[Gal|Gal]] opens the door dramatically, surprising the police officers outside. Their leader screams at her and she tries to defuse the situation by praising them and tempting the leader with the mystery within, however she also angers him by mentioning his wife. he demands the rest of the group come out but she manages to stall them.

A few moments later[[Marius]] tries to go speak to them, but the leader grabs him and pulls him out while [[Nula]] attempts to deescalate. [[Falsair]] comes to the door, frightening the men. [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] tries to get the leader to come in but gets yelled at and shuts the door. [[Marius]] then uses [Calm Emotions](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/calm-emotions) on the man and he walks away. The party leaves out of the back door and returns to the agency.

==Meanwhile, [[Evan]] has already left out of the back door. He gets back to the agency first and meets [[Issha]] who is outside freaking out. [[Evan]] goes inside with him, and is led to the second floor where he meets a man with glowing red eyes. He is [[Beep Boop]]. He tells [[Evan]] that he saw everything through the portraits, and that the party has destroyed a lot of work inside his lab.==

The party then joins [[Evan]] and [[Beep Boop]] in the meeting room. [[Gal|Gal]] offers her hand but he just stares. He tells the party that they have destroyed a valuable resource, and that they will now stay around to do dirty work for him and stay out of his way or be destroyed. The party is then ordered to leave and send [[Issha]] in. During this conversation, [[Nula]] and [[Evan]] notice an engraving on [[Beep Boop]]'s neck that reads "Mk 7" and later reveal this to the rest of the party.

[[Falsair]] shares his knowledge of the [[Ondra#Superheroes|Superheroes]], noting that [[Fengar]] is known to be more powerful than [[Beep Boop]], and that [[Beep Boop]] has six copies designated Mk 1-6, but not Mk 7.

The party then decides to find a place to rest and visit the pubs in [[Ondra#Locations|Barouk District]] near the agency. They visit a pub called [[Ondra#Locations|The Blue Bucket]], run by an old man named [[Paul (Bartender)|Paul]]. [[Evan]] and [[Gal|Gal]] make an arrangement with Paul to host a pub quiz in exchange for free drinks for the party, as well as a room for [[Gal|Gal]] to use as a dressing room. 

Everyone gets a free drink as a sample and they sit down to drink underneath a taxidermized octopus while [[Gal|Gal]] goes upstairs to take a bath.

[[Falsair]] reveals that he has been involved with [[Beep Boop]] before, during his past as a supervillain. He explains that he retired after being betrayed by his team, and that he no longer has any contacts in the industry. He also notes that [[Gal|Gal]] is his great great-great-grandniece (?) and while she knows of his past she was not involved in the trade.
