The [[index#Players and Characters|party]] starts in a meeting room within the building of their hero agency. They have not met before. Here they are introduced to their first mission by [[Issha]], which is to find [[Miss Lucy]]'s 24 cats.

After introducing themselves to each other, the party visits [[Miss Lucy's Home]] to find out more about the cats and the situation, and learns that Miss Lucy has been having trouble with her neighbor [[Fenny]], who lives [[Fenny's Home|across]] from her.

[[Gal|Gal]] consumes mushroom tea, which is hallucinogenic. [[Miss Lucy]] and her neighbors are not able to provide any information or description of Fenny, who is not home. The party breaks in by having [[Nula]] Wild Shape as an owl and descend into the chimney to open the front door from inside.

The party does not find anything interesting other than a large amount of cat-like fur which does not belong to Miss Lucy's cats. [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] and [[Nula]] pull down the massive portrait of [[Beep Boop]] in the living room, revealing the entrance to a tunnel containing multiple tripwire traps. Within, the party can hear the purring and meowing of a "demon cat".

At the end of the tunnel there is a large metal door and a biometric device. [[Gal|Gal]] pours leftover tea on the wires to short-circuit them and open the door. Within, the party finds a large room, containing a hospital bed surrounded by multiple containers of liquid pumping something into a man who looks to be in a vegetative state.

Here, the party is attacked by 4 undead [[Burning Cats]], possibly Miss Lucy's cats. An alarm is triggered, warning of "Projected Wild Shape", and while the party is able to kill 2 of the cats the session ends when an abomination composed of multiple merged cats shows up, a [[Dead Cat Dragon]].
