*02/12/2023*

It is Wednesday.

The [[index#Players|Party]] (minus [[Evan]]) decides to take [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] into the [[Jeff's Lab|beige tunnel]] to chase [[Kevin]] and he confirms that [[Kevin]] is indeed the person that he has been working with all along.

As they go in, they find a reception desk with a blonde human woman in a beige suit sitting behind it, as well as multiple people in business suits sitting at the end of the room on sofas. [[Falsair]] disguises himself as [[Kevin]] and gets one of his zombie elves to carry him in, as he is much shorter. The other four and [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] tie their own hands so that they can easily loosen the knots and pretend that they are captives.

The receptionist's name is [[Reset#Known Members|Leah]]. She does not recognize [[Falsair]] and tells him that the [[Session 4#[The Battle of the Three Jeffs](https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdfGreUJSqw)|beige dwarf]] ran in without saying anything and she assumed that he was running to [[Kevin]]'s office. [[Falsair]] praises her, and tells her that she should take the rest of the day off and buy ~~her mama a house~~ something nice with company money. He also tells the business people to leave.

On [[Reset#Known Members|Leah]]'s desk they find a book where people have been signed in, but no names seem relevant. Having made it past reception, they untie themselves and look through the drawers of the desk. [[Meldohr]] finds a tablet with some runes on it and hands it over to [[Falsair]], who identifies the runes as teleportation runes leading to the teleportation circles under the city. [[Nula]] notices this too.

After reception there is a corridor with three doors, one on each side and one at the end. Behind the door on the left, [[Nula]] hears ~~a vintage 1996 Dyson DC02 Antarctica Solo Edition cylinder vacuum cleaner~~ air blowing briefly, and [[Meldohr]] hears electrical sounds similar to those in [[Jeff's Lab]]. Behind the door at the end [[Meldohr]] hears nothing, so he slams the door open and sees a library with multiple people in beige suits sitting inside. He apologizes and closes the door as they are getting ready to come out, but [[Falsair]] pops his head in and tells them to go take a day off at [[The Blue Bucket]]. 

In the library, [[Gal]] takes a moment to talk to [[Falsair]] and expresses her concern at his behavior, terrorizing people instead of just killing them, which was more fun. Briefly exploring the library, [[Falsair]] notices that all the books are on [Chronomancy](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chronomancy) He picks up the three books that the beige people were reading and gives them to [[Meldohr]] to carry.

After looking at the books, they decide to go through the door on the right, away from the noise. It leads into a corridor that forks, leading to two identical doors. They go back to the door in the left. Inside, they find a row of heat resistant beige overcoats, like those in [[Jeff's Lab]]. They also note that the room feels particularly cold. There is also a door that leads into what looks like an airlock.

### [Kevin's Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvTwxXTaISQ)

[[Gal]] and [[Meldohr]] put on the overcoats and go into the airlock, leaving the rest of the [[index#Players|Party]] locked behind the first door. Beyond the second door they find a lab. There is a creature within a cage that seems to shift locations within, and three elves that are hanging from the wall and being observed by two beige people.

They also notice two artefacts within the room, a golden cloak that disappears when being looked at, and a bracelet that changes color.

Having been noticed, [[Gal]] and [[Meldohr]] try to convince the scientists that they are coworkers, but they see through the lie and one of them tries to run to a door at the end of the room. Before he can reach it, [[Meldohr]] uses ~~an electric charcoal starter~~ Heat Metal to make the door handle red hot, severely burning his hand and causing him to scream and alert the others outside.

After having a very threatening conversation, the scientists warm them about ~~Vince with a lisp~~ [[Vinth]], an extremely dangerous villain and also [[Kevin]]'s boss. 

At this point [[Falsair]] and [[Marius]] dimension door in, having heard the screaming, and [[Marius]] closes the airlock door to allow [[Nula]] to come in. They continue their conversation with the scientists and [[Gal]] befriends the unharmed one, [[Reset#Known Members|Terence]], offering him a job. He explains that [[Vinth]] is experimenting with Chronomancy and wants to have ultimate control over the passing of time.

==[[Marius]] recognizes [[Vinth]] as the member of the [[Marius#Bode Family|Bode family]] that always wears a beige suit.==

The scientists explain how to get to [[Kevin]]'s office. [[Gal]] also asks about getting a job at the lab, and they tell her that she should speak to the Lab Supervisor, [[Reset#Known Members|Christian]]. While she waves him off, [[Meldohr]] heals the guy with the burnt hand, [[Reset#Known Members|Clarence]].

In the meantime, [[Falsair]] and [[Nula]] look around the room and find an infinite spell book, the most powerful spell book [[Falsair]] has ever come across. It is hovering in the air with its own power. [[Falsair]] asks [[Reset#Known Members|Clarence]] whether it is trapped, but the bell that covers it is just an anti magic barrier to hold it down as it is drawn to magical potential nearby. He lifts the anti magic glass, instantly feeling the magic within his body cease to exist. As soon as the book is free, it starts hovering next to him, drawn to his power. 

As [[Falsair]] touches the book, his eyes glaze over ==and he is ripped out of the timeline. He sees a great hall in front of him, similar to a church. It contains gigantic golden statues of different warriors, about 30 feet high. There are pillars everywhere and the room extends infinitely. Looking down, he cannot see his own physical body but instead just floats around.==

==In the hall there is a set of golden stairs encrusted with jewels, leading up to an altar-like structure where the book hovers. A human man is sitting on the throne behind it. He is reading from the book out loud, in a language that [[Falsair]] does not speak. His head turns to look at [[Falsair]] and he immediately snaps back to the lab==, falling to the ground. Once he gets up, the book starts following him.

[[Nula]] is able to read the book. It is written in celestial and contains Chronomancy spells. It is a "Chronal Book". 

[[Gal]] takes the color changing bracelet, and [[Meldohr]] takes the cloak, which seems to flicker as it changes in time. As he wears it, the cloak itself disappears but [[Meldohr]] is still visible underneath.

[[Reset#Known Members|Clarence]] tells the [[index#Players|Party]] that the creature they saw in the cage is a time elemental. They discuss setting it free by cutting power to the whole building. [[Marius]] attempts to send the elemental a message, but receives no response.

### [I Feel The Static](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G6QDNC4jPs)

[[Gal]] puts her hand close to the cage and is able to feel a tingle from the electricity running through it. Seeing this, [[Meldohr]] wants to try the same, but as he approaches the cage his chainmail armor creates a Van der Graaff generator and a bolt of electricity launches him across the room.

They decide to leave, tying [[Reset#Known Members|Clarence]] up and taking him with them. Before they do, they want to attempt to touch the cage with the anti magic bell, but they do not want to lose their magic and [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] and [[Reset#Known Members|Clarence]] refuse to help. [[Falsair]] orders the zombie elf to stay in the room and use his staff to push the bell onto the cage, and asks him to knock on the door in a certain way once it is done.

[[Marius]] tries to message the elemental once again and asks it to avoid causing destruction. They then leave the lab, [[Meldohr]] fireman carrying [[Reset#Known Members|Clarence]], who is so scared of him that he faints. [[Falsair]] also tells the rest that he is not able to use magic, as he is very tired.

Once they have all exited, they have a conversation regarding the use of violence and what they should do next, as [[Marius]] is concerned about the [[index#Players|Party]]'s willingness to kill but [[Falsair]] disagrees. They also discuss whether it is a good time and place to fight [[Kevin]] and potentially [[Vinth]], or whether they should go back to the pub.

Before going ahead, [[Nula]], [[Meldohr]] and [[Gal]] go back to the lab to check on the elemental and take the bell. [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] also gives [[Falsair]] the briefcase with the artefact.

Once inside the airlock, [[Meldohr]] tries to listen behind the second door and hears *an endless sound of nothingness*. The door is extremely cold. They decide that the lack of sound is good, as the previous noises they could hear were coming from the electric cage. 

[[Nula]] opens the airlock door, and as soon as it is unlocked it is completely ripped off the hinges as it opens into a empty space. All they see is the endless stars and planets of the Astral Plane as the difference in pressure causes them to get sucked into the vacuum. All three are able to just about hold on, but they are no longer able to breathe or speak.

Inside, [[Marius]] hears [[Meldohr]] slamming his hammer onto the ground to avoid getting pulled out into space. He attempts to open the door but it is impossible as the second airlock door is gone. Panicking, [[Meldohr]] uses Heat Metal to ~~4th level heat that bitch~~ melt the door's mechanism, allowing [[Marius]] to push it open.

As soon as the door opens, [[Reset#Known Members|Clarence]]'s tied body ~~gets yeeted~~ is immediately pulled through it and he is launched into space. Everyone else is able to hold on before getting pulled into the vacuum. 

Eventually, [[Nula]] summons her Giant Octopus to temporarily block the gap in the wall, allowing the others to successfully hold the door closed and fix it. Back inside, they decide that it would be best to go to [[The Blue Bucket]] to rest before fighting [[Kevin]]. Before they leave, [[Marius]] messages [[Kevin]] ~~about his car's extended warranty~~ to notify him that his lab is gone.
