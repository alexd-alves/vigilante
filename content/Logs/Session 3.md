*04/11/2023*

It is Tuesday evening.

The party is at the [[Ondra#Locations|Blue Bucket]] pub, discussing [[Falsair]]'s past as a villain, while [[Gal|Gal]] takes a bath upstairs. [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] asks the other party members whether they have worked for [[Barouk's Works]] before.

It is [[Nula]]'s first job, following in the footsteps of her late brother's close friend, who works within another team at [[Barouk's Works]]. The other four have also worked with the agency before, although [[Gal|Gal]] and [[Falsair]] have mostly worked on their own.

[[Falsair]] asks about [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] and [[Marius]]'s religious beliefs. [[Marius]] says that he is not religious, but rather has a duty to make the world a better place for his [[Marius#Relationships|daughter]], who is around 7 years old and is currently living with his husband's parents.

During this conversation, the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] also discusses [[Evan]]'s tendency to disappear and go off on his own. He tried to hide to prove a point, but instead just slips under the table.

Getting ready to go ahead with the Pub Quiz that they had agreed with [[Paul]], [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] goes upstairs to take off his chainmail while [[Gal|Gal]] puts on a sequin top. They discuss [[Evan]] before going down, and take a blanket for him as they are concerned by his behavior.

Once downstairs, the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] has a conversation about how to bring patrons in for the Pub Quiz. [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] suggests showing off his strength as a circus act, while [[Evan]] demonstrates how he can summon his bow, which the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] decides to call "Evan's Essence". They also chat some more with [[Paul|Paul]], and discover that his male ancestors are called Taul, Daul, and Andrew.

Finally, they decide to bring people in by going to the other two pubs in the area, the [[Ondra#Locations|Dirty Gnat]] and the [[Ondra#Locations|Bloody Mammoth]], and poaching their patrons. [[Gal|Gal]] crafts 4 stink bombs before going, with the intention to sabotage them.

Meanwhile, [[Nula]] hears a message in her mind from her late brother [[Nula#Relationships|Ryland]]'s friend, [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]], telling her that he is going on a dangerous mission and warning her to be careful. [[Nula]] and [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] are very close. [[Marius]]'s husband has sent a similar message at the same time, although [[Marius]] thinks that it is not particularly unusual. Both [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] and [[Marius]]'s husband work at [[Barouk's Works]], but they are not sure whether they work together in the same team.

While they are all concerned about this, they decide to go ahead with the Pub Quiz and honour their deal with [[Paul|Paul]].

[[Marius]] and [[Meldohr|Meldohr]], less keen on sabotage, stay back to talk to people as they come out of the pubs into the street. [[Evan]] gets a board with samples, drinks them all and then stands outside impressively spinning the board as a sign.

[[Gal|Gal]] causes chaos inside the [[Ondra#Locations|Dirty Gnat]] by throwing one of her stink bombs in, which causes it to fill with smoke. [[Nula]] and [[Falsair]] go to the [[Ondra#Locations|Bloody Mammoth]], where [[Nula]] conjures some rats while [[Falsair]] aids her by distracting people as she casts the spell. ==As she conjures the rats, she notices that 1 out of 8 shine briefly, similarly to the Giant Octopus after [[Session 2|drinking the chemicals]] in [[Beep Boop]]'s [[Fenny's Home|lab]]==.

As people come out of the pubs, they are herded into the [[Ondra#Locations|Blue Bucket]] by the rest of the party, bringing in around 17 people for the Pub Quiz.

### Gal Glitterbomb's Glorious Grogshop Gameshow

Inside the pub, while [[Paul|Paul]] attempts to explain what a Pub Quiz is, [[Marius]] and [[Falsair]] create effects for [[Gal|Gal]]'s entrance. She climbs up on the bar and plays the Glaur, which looks like a cornucopia and sounds like a trumpet. She tells the crowd to tell them to buy their drinks and sit down.

[[Meldohr|Meldohr]] and [[Nula]] help [[Paul|Paul]] pour drinks, as the pub is now beginning to fill up. [[Evan]] is outside, trying to form a queue and charge people for entering the pub, while [[Marius]] takes the team names inside and tries to charge participants again.

The [[Ondra#Locations|Party]] decides that the prize, which is a surprise, will actually be 5 GP, with additional points given to the team that buys most drinks and the team with the best team name. They also find out that [[Paul|Paul]]'s brother and co-owner is named Saul.

[[Nula]] and [[Falsair]] form a team as well: Meldohr on the Dance Floor.

At this point, the pub is very busy and there is a long queue outside. [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] begins selling drinks through the window at the front, keeping the money aside with the intention to pay [[Paul|Paul]] for the kegs.

==While outside working as a bouncer, [[Evan]] notices 5 robins, flying 40 to 50 feet away, possibly watching.==

The Pub Quiz is very successful, with the following teams twelve teams taking part: 

* My Chemical Gnomance
* Silver Piece Maiden
* Nothing Elves Matter
* Imagine Dragons
* Evan's Essence
* Name Team
* How Much Did You Say Entry Was
* Meldohr on the Dance Floor
* As a Group
* That Team Gold
* Team 11
* Team 12

Name Team wins the Pub Quiz after a tie breaker with Meldohr on the Dance Floor involving chugging a drink as fast as possible, despite [[Falsair]]'s attempts to cheat with a Command spell. They winning team takes 5 GP as a prize.

[[Meldohr|Meldohr]] earns 154 GP serving drinks at the window, but he pays [[Paul|Paul]] 48 GP for the four kegs used, while [[Gal|Gal]] manages to collect some tips. Once the pub is quiet, the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] decides to meet in the same place in the morning to go check on [[Issha]] at [[Barouk's Works]].

[[Meldohr|Meldohr]] returns to the temple, lighting a candle to pray and leaving 5 GP as an offer to [[Allia]] before going to his bedroom, where he falls asleep re-reading the last letter he received from his sister.

==[[Evan]] notices one of the robins following him, and decides to return to the [[Ondra#Locations|Blue Bucket]]. He finds the window that [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] was selling drinks out of unlocked, and goes upstairs to sleep in one of the rooms.==

==[[Marius]], not seeing anyone watching him, decides to visit his daughter [[Marius#Relationships|Eudora]], who is staying with his husband's parents, [[Marius#Relationships|Liluth]] and [[Marius#Relationships|Galan]]. After finding them all sleeping, he returns to his own home. In the morning, still not seeing anything out of the normal, he visits [[Marius#Relationships|Eudora]] again, before heading to the [[Ondra#Locations|Blue Bucket]].==

==[[Nula]], concerned about [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]], searches their home in search for anything strange, but finds nothing. She tries to use [Scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying)to check on him. She goes to bed but is kept up by thoughts of her friend. In the morning, she tries [Scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying) again, but it fails.==

==[[Falsair]] and [[Gal|Gal]] stop by a store in the morning, where [[Gal|Gal]] tries to convince the shopkeeper to purchase some of her items, such as the Guiltless Gambit Guns, but he is not convinced.==

### [Faded in the Morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL2XVzckCI0)

In the morning, the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] meets at the [[Ondra#Locations|Blue Bucket]] to have breakfast. 

[[Nula]] gives [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] permission to pluck a feather from her when she transforms into an owl. She also tells the others what she saw when she tried to see [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]]: he was hiding along with three other people that she did not recognise near a skyscraper and they were hit by some form of magic, causing one of them to start convulsing, and then there was a big explosive. [[Marius]] describes his husband, but [[Nula]] is so shaken up that she cannot tell whether she saw him.

After waiting for [[Evan]] for a while they decide to leave him a note, telling him that they have gone to [[Barouk's Works]]. [[Marius]] thinks that the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] should be careful not to overwhelm [[Issha]], while [[Falsair]] suggests they speak to [[Barouk's Works|Karen]] from HR. 

On the way, they discuss [[Nula]]'s vision. [[Gal|Gal]] says that she has not seen any skyscrapers in [[Ondra]], but [[Falsair]] identifies the building as "[[Justice]]", the [[Ondra#Superheroes|Superhero's]] HQ. [[Nula]] also notes that she saw [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] speaking to his companions in a language that she did not recognize, but is unable to demonstrate. [[Marius]] and [[Nula]] are convinced that [[Nula#Relationship|Aric]] is not up to anything nefarious.

Once at [[Barouk's Works]], the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] heads to reception, where they encounter [[Issha]]. He is very confident and upbeat, which is somewhat confusing. [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] notices a device in [[Issha]]'s right eye and tries to speak to [[Falsair]] while [[Issha]] leads them to the meeting room upstairs. As [[Issha]] notices them speaking, [[Falsair]] initiates a mental conversation, and once [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] tells him of the device he goes ahead and relays this to the rest of the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] (minus [[Evan]]). 

[[Issha]] gives the team a new mission: they must escort [[Jeff Fishkin]] home from the [[Barouk's Works]] building. He is desperate and believes that he is being followed home. He is also receiving death threats. He works at a "top secret" location, developing magical items.

[[Issha]] also mentions his mother, [[Ensari]], and his siblings: [[Issha#Relationships|Ahssi]] and [[Issha#Relationships|Haiche]]. He also tries to grill [[Meldohr|Meldohr]], but [[Gal|Gal]] distracts him by asking what kind of cologne he is wearing.

[[Nula]] asks [[Issha]] about obtaining information on other teams that work at the agency, but he says it is very confidential. The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] decides to speak to [[Barouk's Works|Karen]] instead, who has an office down the hall.

### [Somebody Told Him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5fBdpreJiU)

Once at the HR office, the team attempts to speak to [[Barouk's Works|Karen]] about their pay but she directs them to the Finance department. She also refuses [[Falsair]]'s bribe in exchange for information on the other teams, but implies that she might accept it if they are alone. 

To be able to look through her files, [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] convinces her that [[Barouk's Works|Jenny]] from Finance has been talking behind her back, and they all decide to go confront her at the Finance office across the hall.

While they all walk towards [[Barouk's Works|Jenny]]'s office, [[Nula]] stays behind to try to break in. ==She turns into a mouse to slide under the HR door and look for files on [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]], but all the cabinets are locked. Back to her human form, she breaks one of the cabinets open with an ice knife, but the records within it belong to the letter "M".==

Once at [[Barouk's Works|Jenny]]'s door, [[Gal|Gal]] convinces [[Barouk's Works|Karen]] to purchase a stink bomb from her, so she can teach [[Barouk's Works|Jenny]] a lesson. She agrees, then cracks open the bomb with her teeth and throws it through the door to the Finance office before closing it and running back to her own office. 

[[Falsair]] tries to trip [[Barouk's Works|Karen]] up to buy [[Nula]] some time but fails. However, she does not notice [[Nula]] exiting the office in her mouse form. 

Back inside the HR office, she demands that [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] tells her what [[Barouk's Works|Jenny]] has said about her. He tells her that she called her mother a whore, which [[Barouk's Works|Karen]] agrees is accurate, and that she saw her and [[Barouk's Works|John]] the Janitor spending time alone in her office.

Hoping that [[Falsair]] can convince her to release the confidential files, the rest of the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] waits outside while they stay inside the HR office. ==He frightens her and tells her that she has probably really upset [[Barouk's Works|Jenny]], and that this could cost her her job. He then convinces her to go home and take some time to look after her own mental health before returning to log a complaint against herself on behalf of [[Barouk's Works|Jenny]].==

Once he is alone in the office he calls the team back in to help him, as [[Barouk's Works|Karen]] has left him a set of 50 keys that match 35 locks in the office. [[Gal|Gal]] and [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] try to identify any patterns in the keys and locks, but they both fail.
