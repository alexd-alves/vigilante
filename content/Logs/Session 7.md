> [!info] Thursday morning, around 9am.

The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] is back at [[The Blue Bucket]]. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] is unconscious, and [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]]'s corpse is on the ground. The rifts are gone, but they can still feel the static in the air.

> [!warning] Meldohr
> As [[Meldohr]] goes unconscious, he is now back on the hillside, where he was born. He can hear his sister, Gwendeth, calling for him to follow. He himself is also his younger self. He chases her through the trees and into a dark cave, as she yells for him to come see something amazing. He follows and, at the end of the cave, he can see red light and a flash of scales, but as he gets closer to the examine the light everything goes dark.
> 
> He opens his eyes again, and he is now older. His brother is there, in full armor, pummeling a training dummy with his hammer, and he is encouraging [[Meldohr]] to keep training hard. Then, he blinks, and he is now on the battlefield, holding his brother's limp body. He is bloodied and his arm is no longer there. All around he can hear screaming and the sounds of battle, but he does not let go of his brother. Then, an explosion, and as he is thrown back everything goes dark again.
> 
> Another scene. [[Meldohr]] is on his knees, hands tied. Blood is pouring from his ears, his mouth, and the wounds on his body. Behind him, a man demands information and keeps whipping his back in response to his silence. As the pain become unbearable, he falls face first and closes his eyes. 
> 
>Finally, he opens his eyes and he is back at the temple that has become his home. As [[Meldohr]] kneels, High Priest [[Tomek]] reminds him that he is now safe. And as the Priest speaks, his voice morphs into the soft voice of a woman, and [[Meldohr]] feels himself enveloped by [[Allia]]'s golden robe.
>
>And then, everything is gone.

At the pub, [[Nula]] checks on [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] as [[Falsair]] reminds [[Evan]] that keeping him safe was his responsibility. He is definitely dead, but hasn't been for long, so [[Nula]] is able to bring him back with [Revivify](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Revivify#content). 

Then, she runs over to [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] and heals him. He snaps back into himself, screaming. Looking around, the first thing he asks is where [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] is. [[Marius]] tells him that he was left behind, and [[Gal]] adds that he was protecting them as they exited the rifts.

[[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] explains that they were not there willingly but were teleported in. When [[Gal]] asks him about [[Vinth]] he says that he does not know who that is, he just turned up and started screaming about a fight between himself and [[Beep Boop]], but he was helping as they were barely managing so they allowed him.

[[Nula]] was very worried after she received the message informing her that [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] was going on a dangerous mission, and she demands an explanation. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] tells them that they had been sent to investigate something going on in [[Justice]]. At some point, [[Fengar]] had gotten in touch with [[Ensari]], a childhood friend. He had found a plot or something suspicious within [[Justice]] and needed help to investigate. [[Falsair]] suggests that if [[Ensari]] was there she might be dead by now.

At first, [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] is reluctant to share, but he owes the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] his life and so he reveals that there was a fourth member of the team: [[Asta]]. He was the man that [[Nula]] watched shaking and convulsing when scrying. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] is sure that he is dead. The four of them had attempted to infiltrate [[Justice]], but had been spotted by a large flying creature and had to make a run for it. The creature was very high up and unidentifiable.

While [[Ensari]] ran in a different direction, [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]], [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] and [[Asta]] tried to flee the battlefield. However, they encountered a large figure standing in their way.

> [!quote]
> <font color="grey">ARIC:</font> It was what I can only explain as some sort of enhanced [[Beep Boop]]. I have seen him before, but in this form he was terrifying.

Then suddenly, [[Beep Boop]]'s hand was already on them and they were shifted into the plane where the [[Session 6|bot fight]] happened.

[[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] promises that if [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] is still there, he will find him and bring him back, but he does not know what happened to [[Ensari]]. [[Gal]] explains that they have previously met her son, [[Issha]], and tells [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] that [[Beep Boop]] has placed a device in his eye and might now be controlling him, so he cannot be trusted. [[Falsair]] also informs him of [[Fengar]]'s [[Session 2|death]]. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] notes that [[Fengar]] had been worried about [[Beep Boop]]'s insistence on asking about the mechanics of his magic.

They also discuss the possibility of talking to [[Benny]], as he created [[Beep Boop]]. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] doesn't have a direct way on contact him, but he suggests finding [[Ensari]] as she has better contacts.

[[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] also suggests that the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] stays somewhere secret, and he himself has a safehouse where he might be able to stay once he confirms it is not compromised. [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] suggests his [[Jeff's Lab|lab]], even though there are some concerns about it collapsing into itself.

[[Marius]] is worried about his family, and [[Falsair]] is concerned that perhaps all of [[Justice]] is involved in [[Beep Boop]]'s evil plans. [[Evan]] offers a place where they can hide or hide their families, some sort of a secret lair, and, despite [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]]'s warning that keeping everyone together might put a target on them, [[Marius]] decides to take [[Marius#Thello Family|Eudora]] there along with her grandparents, [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] and [[Marius#Thello Family|Liluth]].

After promising to keep in touch, [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] leaves to get the search underway, and [[Gal]] changes into her black sequin dress in mourning for [[Meldohr]]. [[Falsair]] also takes a moment to straighten up the Octopus on the wall, over the plaque that [[Meldohr]] crafted to mark their favorite spot. Then, [[Gal]] gets a pint from the bar and pours it out in [[Meldohr]]'s memory.

[[Falsair]] explains how the day started to [[Marius]], who was not there, and he suggests going back to [[Reset]]'s base to collect some of their research. [[Marius]] suggests that, while he and [[Evan]] collect [[Marius#Thello Family|Eudora]] from school, the rest go back to [[Jeff's Lab]] to find out if it has been compromised.

[[Falsair]] also proposes going to [[Allia]]'s temple, where [[Meldohr]] lived. While [[Meldohr]] hadn't spoken much about his religion, [[Falsair]] knows that according to [[Ondra#Religion|Ondran]] beliefs it is [[Meldohr]]'s cult of [[Allia]] that would know anything about resurrection. [[Gal]] suggests checking in at the temple before taking care of more important matters.

> [!warning] Falsair
> [[Falsair]] pulls his notebook out, and on the bottom he writes [[Vinth]]'s name and then scratches it off. Above that is [[Fengar]]'s name.

Before the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] splits, [[Marius]] takes some time to split some of the gold they had earned from Tuesday's [[Session 3|Pub Quiz]]. They also decide to obtain some [sending stones](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sending-stones) to be able to keep in touch with each other. [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] suggests getting some from his [[Jeff's Lab|lab]], or going to the black market under the city. [[Nula]] comments that it seems dodgy, and [[Falsair]] responds by hinting that [[Marius]] is dodgy, which [[Marius]] does not seem happy about.

> [!warning] Falsair and Marius
> Before leaving, [[Falsair]] tugs on [[Marius]]'s sleeve and asks him is he is okay. [[Marius]] responds that he is not, and [[Falsair]] promises that they will do everything they can to find [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]].

The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] splits into two groups: Team School, made up of [[Marius]] and [[Evan]], and Team Temple, made up of [[Falsair]], [[Gal]] and [[Nula]], as well as [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]].

> [!warning] Team School (Marius and Evan)
> As they travel towards [[Marius#Thello Family|Eudora]]'s school, [[Marius]] is watching for danger. He doesn't notice anything, but he is distracted thinking of [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]]. [[Evan]] is looking for birds, but he sees none.
> 
> Eventually, they arrive to the [[Marius#Thello Family|Thellos']] home. It has a very well kept front garden, with little stone and marble ornaments, as well as a flower bed that [[Marius#Thello Family|Eudora]] has been working on. [[Marius]] knocks on the door and [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] comes out, surprised to see him. 
> 
> [[Marius]] explains that [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] is in danger, and therefore so are themselves and [[Marius#Thello Family|Eudora]]. [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] closes the door and asks [[Marius]] to take a walk with him, as he does not want to worry [[Marius#Thello Family|Liluth]]. He also introduces himself to [[Evan]], who calls him dad.
> 
> [[Marius]] tells [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] that powerful people are after them, and that after they fought them alongside [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] they were able to get out but had to left [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] behind. [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] tries to make him feel better, telling him that his son is strong and will be fine. They will go with [[Evan]] if [[Marius]] believes that is the best option. He suggests going to the school and saying that she has to see a doctor. On the way back, he also pulls [[Evan]] in, assuming that he has daddy issues.

> When they return to the house, [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] goes in and come back out with [[Marius#Thello Family|Liluth]], who is not quite sure what is happening and is concerned about her book club. [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] introduces [[Evan]], making sure to tell her that he apparently needs some parenting. He also calls her mom.
