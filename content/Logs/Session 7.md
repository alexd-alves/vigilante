*14/01/2024*

> [!hint] TL;DR
> Nula heals Aric and brings Jeff back. Aric explains that he, alongside Ensari, Aeris and someone called Asta, had gone infiltrate Justice. Fengar is a childhood friend of Ensari, and he asked her for help after he discovered some sort of plot within Justice. Aric is going to try to find Aeris while the Party makes sure that Marius's family is safe.
> 
> Evan offers a secret place to hide Eudora and her grandparents, so he and Marius go take them to Evan's lair. Evan stays there while Marius meets the rest at Jeff's lab. They also find two set of sending stones in Evan's lair, one for Marius to communicate with his family and one for when the party splits.
> 
> At the same time, the rest of the Party go to Meldohr's temple to let them know about his death and find out whether they can bring him back. There they meet Meldohr's brother, Gwyn, who has previously met Gal. He joins the Party to help them find and kill Beep Boop and his army. Jeff also shows them how to use his magic artifact.
> 
> Then they go to Jeff's lab, and Marius meets them there with Lachlan, an intern that Issha has sent to find them. There they also find a letter addressed to Marius, from his father Loris Bode, letting him know that they are aware of his recent work with Falsair. They get another sets of sending stones from Jeff so he can communicate with them.
> 
> The Party decides that Lachlan is no danger, and they try to get back into Reset to retrieve their research, but find that the place has been filled with concrete. Since they cannot get there, they decide to try to get in from the other side and also go to Barouk's Works and collect payment for completing their mission, while Gwyn stays with Jeff in the lab to protect him while he works on some sort of communication device.

> [!info] Thursday morning, around 9am.

The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] is back at [[The Blue Bucket]]. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] is unconscious, and [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]]'s corpse is on the ground. The rifts are gone, but they can still feel the static in the air.

> [!warning] Meldohr
> As [[Meldohr]] goes unconscious, he is now back on the hillside, where he was born. He can hear his sister, Gwendeth, calling for him to follow. He himself is also his younger self. He chases her through the trees and into a dark cave, as she yells for him to come see something amazing. He follows and, at the end of the cave, he can see red light and a flash of scales, but as he gets closer to the examine the light everything goes dark.
> 
> He opens his eyes again, and he is now older. His brother is there, in full armor, pummeling a training dummy with his hammer, and he is encouraging [[Meldohr]] to keep training hard. Then, he blinks, and he is now on the battlefield, holding his brother's limp body. He is bloodied and his arm is no longer there. All around he can hear screaming and the sounds of battle, but he does not let go of his brother. Then, an explosion, and as he is thrown back everything goes dark again.
> 
> Another scene. [[Meldohr]] is on his knees, hands tied. Blood is pouring from his ears, his mouth, and the wounds on his body. Behind him, a man demands information and keeps whipping his back in response to his silence. As the pain become unbearable, he falls face first and closes his eyes. 
> 
>Finally, he opens his eyes and he is back at the temple that has become his home. As [[Meldohr]] kneels, High Priest [[Tomek]] reminds him that he is now safe. And as the Priest speaks, his voice morphs into the soft voice of a woman, and [[Meldohr]] feels himself enveloped by [[Allia]]'s golden robe.
>
>And then, everything is gone.

At the pub, [[Nula]] checks on [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] as [[Falsair]] reminds [[Evan]] that keeping him safe was his responsibility. He is definitely dead, but hasn't been for long, so [[Nula]] is able to bring him back with [Revivify](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Revivify#content). 

### [Pouring One Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HMRLEceXMM)

#MissingHeroes Then, she runs over to [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] and heals him. He snaps back into himself, screaming. Looking around, the first thing he asks is where [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] is. [[Marius]] tells him that he was left behind, and [[Gal]] adds that he was protecting them as they exited the rifts.

[[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] explains that they were not there willingly but were teleported in. When [[Gal]] asks him about [[Vinth]] he says that he does not know who that is, he just turned up and started screaming about a fight between himself and [[Beep Boop]], but he was helping as they were barely managing so they allowed him.

#EvilBoop [[Nula]] was very worried after she received the message informing her that [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] was going on a dangerous mission, and she demands an explanation. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] tells them that they had been sent to investigate something going on in [[Justice]]. At some point, [[Fengar]] had gotten in touch with [[Ensari]], a childhood friend. He had found a plot or something suspicious within [[Justice]] and needed help to investigate. [[Falsair]] suggests that if [[Ensari]] was there she might be dead by now.

At first, [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] is reluctant to share, but he owes the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] his life and so he reveals that there was a fourth member of the team: [[Asta]]. He was the man that [[Nula]] watched shaking and convulsing when scrying. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] is sure that he is dead. The four of them had attempted to infiltrate [[Justice]], but had been spotted by a large flying creature and had to make a run for it. The creature was very high up and unidentifiable.

> <font color="grey">EVAN:</font> (twitching) The birds...

While [[Ensari]] ran in a different direction, [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]], [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] and [[Asta]] tried to flee the battlefield. However, they encountered a large figure standing in their way.

> [!quote]
> <font color="grey">ARIC:</font> It was what I can only explain as some sort of enhanced [[Beep Boop]]. I have seen him before, but in this form he was terrifying.

Then suddenly, [[Beep Boop]]'s hand was already on them and they were shifted into the plane where the [[Session 6|bot fight]] happened.

#FutureBoopThrall [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] promises that if [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] is still there, he will find him and bring him back, but he does not know what happened to [[Ensari]]. [[Gal]] explains that they have previously met her son, [[Issha]], and tells [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] that [[Beep Boop]] has placed a device in his eye and might now be controlling him, so he cannot be trusted. [[Falsair]] also informs him of [[Fengar]]'s [[Session 2|death]]. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] notes that [[Fengar]] had been worried about [[Beep Boop]]'s insistence on asking about the mechanics of his magic.

#FindingEnsari They also discuss the possibility of talking to [[Benny]], as he created [[Beep Boop]]. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] doesn't have a direct way on contact him, but he suggests finding [[Ensari]] as she has better contacts.

[[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] also suggests that the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] stays somewhere secret, and he himself has a safehouse where he might be able to stay once he confirms it is not compromised. [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] suggests his [[Jeff's Lab|lab]], even though there are some concerns about it collapsing into itself.

[[Marius]] is worried about his family, and [[Falsair]] is concerned that perhaps all of [[Justice]] is involved in [[Beep Boop]]'s evil plans. [[Evan]] offers a place where they can hide or hide their families, some sort of a secret lair, and, despite [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]]'s warning that keeping everyone together might put a target on them, [[Marius]] decides to take [[Marius#Thello Family|Eudora]] there along with her grandparents, [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] and [[Marius#Thello Family|Liluth]].

After promising to keep in touch, [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] leaves to get the search underway, and [[Gal]] changes into her black sequin dress in mourning for [[Meldohr]]. [[Falsair]] also takes a moment to straighten up the Octopus on the wall, over the plaque that [[Meldohr]] crafted to mark their favorite spot. Then, [[Gal]] gets a pint from the bar and pours it out in [[Meldohr]]'s memory.

[[Falsair]] explains how the day started to [[Marius]], who was not there, and he suggests going back to [[Reset]]'s base to collect some of their research. [[Marius]] suggests that, while he and [[Evan]] collect [[Marius#Thello Family|Eudora]] from school, the rest go back to [[Jeff's Lab]] to find out if it has been compromised.

#AnotherResurrectionArc [[Falsair]] also proposes going to [[Allia]]'s temple, where [[Meldohr]] lived. While [[Meldohr]] hadn't spoken much about his religion, [[Falsair]] knows that according to [[Ondra#Religion|Ondran]] beliefs it is [[Meldohr]]'s cult of [[Allia]] that would know anything about resurrection. [[Gal]] suggests checking in at the temple before taking care of more important matters.

> [!warning] Falsair
> [[Falsair]] pulls his notebook out, and on the bottom he writes [[Vinth]]'s name and then scratches it off. Above that is [[Fengar]]'s name.

Before the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] splits, [[Marius]] takes some time to share some of the gold they had earned from Tuesday's [[Session 3|Pub Quiz]]. They also decide to obtain some [sending stones](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sending-stones) to be able to keep in touch with each other. [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] suggests getting some from his [[Jeff's Lab|lab]], or going to the black market under the city. [[Nula]] comments that it seems dodgy, and [[Falsair]] responds by hinting that [[Marius]] is dodgy, which [[Marius]] does not seem happy about.

> [!warning] Falsair and Marius
> Before leaving, [[Falsair]] tugs on [[Marius]]'s sleeve and asks him is he is okay. [[Marius]] responds that he is not, and [[Falsair]] promises that they will do everything they can to find [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]].

### [Splitting the Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUMCIn2swTU)

The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] splits into two groups: Team School, made up of [[Marius]] and [[Evan]], and Team Temple, made up of [[Falsair]], [[Gal]] and [[Nula]], as well as [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]].

> [!warning] Team School (Marius and Evan)
> As they travel towards [[Marius#Thello Family|Eudora]]'s school, [[Marius]] is watching for danger. He doesn't notice anything, but he is distracted thinking of [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]]. [[Evan]] is looking for birds, but he sees none.
> 
> Eventually, they arrive to the [[Marius#Thello Family|Thellos']] home. It has a very well kept front garden, with little stone and marble ornaments, as well as a flower bed that [[Marius#Thello Family|Eudora]] has been working on. [[Marius]] knocks on the door and [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] comes out, surprised to see him. 
> 
> [[Marius]] explains that [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] is in danger, and therefore so are themselves and [[Marius#Thello Family|Eudora]]. [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] closes the door and asks [[Marius]] to take a walk with him, as he does not want to worry [[Marius#Thello Family|Liluth]]. He also introduces himself to [[Evan]], who calls him dad.
> 
> [[Marius]] tells [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] that powerful people are after them, and that after they fought them alongside [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] they were able to get out but had to left [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] behind. [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] tries to make him feel better, telling him that his son is strong and will be fine. They will go with [[Evan]] if [[Marius]] believes that is the best option. He suggests going to the school and saying that she has to see a doctor. On the way back, he also pulls [[Evan]] in, assuming that he has daddy issues.

> >
> ><font color="grey">GALAN:</font> (patting him on the shoulder) Hi, son.
> 
> When they return to the house, [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] goes in and comes back out with [[Marius#Thello Family|Liluth]], who is not quite sure what is happening and is concerned about her book club. [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] introduces [[Evan]], making sure to tell her that he apparently needs some parenting. He also calls her mom.
> 
> They all go to the school, and [[Marius#Thello Family|Galan]] leaves them outside while he goes inside to fetch [[Marius#Thello Family|Eudora]]. She comes out a bit confused, more so seeing her dad in full armor. He crouches down to give her a hug and talk to her.
> 
> > [!quote]
> > 
> ><font color="grey">MARIUS:</font> Hey sweetie. We have to stay elsewhere for a bit.
> >
> ><font color="grey">EUDORA:</font> Yeah, grandad said. Will it be fun?
> >
> ><font color="grey">M:</font> We'll try to make it fun. This is [[Evan]], one of my friends.
> >
> ><font color="grey">E:</font> He looks weird.
> 
> [[Evan]] tells the child that there are a lot of toys where they are going, and [[Marius]] whispers to him to maybe only show her the child safe ones.
> 
> On their way to [[Evan]]'s lair they are still checking around for danger, but nobody seems to be following them.

> [!warning] Team Temple (Nula, Gal and Falsair + Jeff)
> On their way to the temple, [[Nula]] asks [[Gal]] if they should do something with [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]]'s artifact. [[Gal]] is carrying the orb, which is currently just a metal sphere. [[Falsair]] really wants it back, so after a brief argument she hands it to him. [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] suggests he can take it back, but [[Gal]] says no.
> 
> [[Gal]] is also worrying that letting [[Vinth]] die might result in someone taking over [[Reset]]. [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] also mentions that [[Kevin]] is not actually his coworker, Kevin, they just both happen to be bird men. While [[Kevin]] resembled a bald eagle, coworker Kevin was like a parakeet.
> 
> Eventually, they all arrive at the temple. It is a bit run down, as they do not have the income to keep it well maintained. While there are some volunteers doing their best, religious groups have no real support in the city.
> 
> [[Gal]] suggests they go in, respectfully, and find a private place to break the news. They can see people cleaning, a place for offerings, and also a man in grey robes with the same symbol that [[Meldohr]] had on his shield. He is talking to a dwarf, telling him how [[Meldohr]] did a lot of good for the temple, using his stone carving skills to restore large portions of the stonework.
> 
> The dwarf and [[Gal]] recognize each other. He is [[Gwyn]], an old acquaintance, and the man in the robes is High Priest [[Tomek]]. [[Gwyn]] introduces himself as [[Meldohr]]'s brother, and [[Gal]] tells him and [[Tomek]] that they need to talk in a private place. [[Tomek]] takes them to his office, and on the way there [[Falsair]] drops a coin into the donations box, but also uses magic to make it sound like it's a lot of coins.
> 
> [[Falsair]] waits outside with [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] to give [[Gal]] some privacy. Inside the office, [[Gal]] lets [[Gwyn]] and [[Tomek]] know that [[Meldohr]] is dead.
> 
> [[Gwyn]] asks [[Gal]] to accompany him to [[Meldohr]]'s room, as he doesn't know the others  but he wants to see if his brother left anything useful, and [[Tomek]] leads them there.
> 
> #AnotherResurrectionArc While [[Gwyn]] searches the room, [[Gal]] asks [[Tomek]] quietly whether he knows anything about resurrection. He explains that it is something he has read about but there is not a lot of knowledge around, and it is not something he himself can do. There are, however, some scriptures about it, which mention a sanctum in the land outside the city that has been ravaged by multiple wars in [[Ondra]]'s history. It is said to contain a means to commune with [[Allia]], and potentially grant the power to resurrect someone. He is not sure that it is true. [[Gal]] tells him that they might be able to do something, and asks him to get in touch with them at [[The Blue Bucket]] if he can help.
> 
> In [[Meldohr]]'s room, [[Gwyn]] finds a cask of ale under the bed, and a portrait that [[Meldohr]] had commissioned of them two together. He takes some time to catch up with [[Gal]], and tells her that the farm machines have gone haywire again, killing his wife and destroying the farm. [[Gwyn]] decides that he wants to join the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] and smite the machines that killed his brother.
> 
> Outside, [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] shows [[Falsair]] and [[Nula]] how to activate the artifact and turn it into a glove. It will duplicate the user's magical wellspring. [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] warns them that it will probably be destroyed after the first use. [[Falsair]] also asks [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] if he has any family. He says he does not, to which [[Falsair]] responds "good".
> 
> When they all meet outside, [[Gwyn]] is carrying the ale cask. He also shows [[Falsair]] the Growth Gear's boot ability, and uses [Longstrider](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Longstrider#content) to help the gnomes get to [[Jeff's Lab]] faster.
