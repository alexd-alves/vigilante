*16/12/2023*

> [!hint] TL;DR
> The Party takes some time to eat, rest, and get acquainted with their new magic items. At the end of the night, Marius returns home, while the rest stay in the pub. Everyone goes upstairs except Evan and Jeff, who sleep on the booth.
> 
> In the morning, Kevin shows up and with him a series of rifts in space. As the Party gets ready to fight him, they spot people in a battle on the other side of the rifts: Vinth, Aric and Aeris. When Kevin uses the last of his vital energy to shift them all into the battlefield, they see they are fighting against a formation of Beep Boop copies.
> 
> During the battle, Vinth and Meldohr are disintegrated. Aeris convinces Marius (who arrives halfway through) to leave him behind, and pushes Aric out as well as the rifts are closing. Evan is able to get Jeff through, but when they come out on the other side Jeff is dead.


>[!note]  Wednesday evening.

The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] gets on their way to [[The Blue Bucket]], planning on resting for the night before returning to confront [[Kevin]], even though they sent the [[Reset|beige people]] to drink there. [[Falsair]] is still being followed by the ==Chronal Book==.

As they arrive to [[The Blue Bucket]],they find the place very busy, as it is now a very popular place thanks to [[Gal]]'s Pub Quiz. [[Evan]] is inside, playing rollies and drinking with the [[Reset|beige people]]. [[Meldohr]] spends some time helping [[Paul]] while [[Falsair]] gets a free room key to go rest. [[Gal]] decides to share room with [[Falsair]] while [[Meldohr]] and [[Nula]] get their own rooms.

### [It Look Like I Been Cookin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4NYSwNAo08)

[[Falsair]] goes to his room while everyone else gathers at the Octopus table. [[Meldohr]] uses the pub's kitchen to make a stew, and he makes plans with [[Marius]] to cook breakfast and try to sell it in the morning.

>[!warning] Falsair
> While the rest makes the meal, [[Falsair]] spends some time in his room attuning to the Chronal Book. While he does not recover his ability to use magic yet, he learns of some perks of having the Book. He also learns that the Book is in an "Unawakened" state.
>

#MissingHeroes [[Meldohr]] also takes some stew up for [[Falsair]], along with some stale moldy bread (his favorite). Afterwards, while [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] and [[Evan]] have a cry and the others eat, [[Nula]] takes some time to check in on [[Marius]], and ask how he feels about his missing [[Marius#Thello Family|husband]].
[[Marius]] is worried about it, but he also thinks that [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] can look after himself. [[Nula]] think the same of [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]]. 

[[Meldohr]] also spends some time crafting a plaque out of the barrels in the pub, so that later he can engrave the Party's name on it and place it under the Octopus at their favorite table. He discusses with [[Gal]] briefly, but they agree on deciding on a name later.

Eventually everyone goes up to their rooms to rest, while [[Marius]] decides to go home, in case his husband returns. [[Gal]] and [[Meldohr]] spend some time getting familiar with their new items from Kevin's lab

### [Do You Think You're Better Off Alone](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgs9QUtWc3M>)

> [!note] Thursday morning. [[Marius]] is not present.

> [!warning] Evan
> In the morning, [[Evan]] wakes up in the booth downstairs, having slept there with [[Jeff]]. He notices "cracks" forming in the air inside the pub, sort of like tears or rifts in space, crackling and pulsating. He notices that the energy is similar as that of [[Kevin]]'s astral arms. 
> 
> [[Evan]] decides to shoot an arrow through one of the rifts, and watches it disappear in it and then fly out from a rift across the room. The energy begins to build around the front door as it slams open, revealing [[Kevin]].

#BeigeStalkers [[Kevin]] is screaming in agony, waking everyone up. Half of his body almost burnt off, his limbs on that side ripped off and replaced by the astral limbs.

> [!warning] Evan
> [[Kevin]] demands [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] and his artifact. Instead, [[Evan]] chooses to grab a mug and throw it into the rift, making it shoot out directly at [[Kevin]], but he is able to deflect it. [[Evan]] notices that using his energy to deflect the mug causes the rifts to open up further, the astral plane behind them becoming visible. In one of them a man in a beige suit is visible, as well as a tall elven man and a woolly mammoth, all fighting against a large formation of [[Beep Boop|Beep Boops]]. 
>
> [[Evan]] tries to get [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] to run upstairs and warn the others, but accidentally knocks him out instead. 
> 

Upstairs, everyone is awoken by the scream. [[Nula]] recognizes the screaming voice as [[Kevin]] and they get [[Gal]] and [[Falsair]]. ~~Meanwhile, [[Marius]] is chilling at home.~~ Going down to check on [[Evan]], [[Gal]] makes an entrance by sliding down the stairs. Everyone ~~except [[Marius]]~~ can now see [[Kevin]] and the rifts, as well as the people within them. 

#MissingHeroes [[Nula]] recognizes the woolly mammoth as [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]]. He and his allies look weakened as they fight the army of [[Beep Boop|Beep Boops]]. They all recognize the elven man as [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]]. 

> [!warning] Marius
> Far, far away, [[Marius]] gets on his way to [[The Blue Bucket]] for breakfast with [[Meldohr]]. A few blocks away he can already hear [[Kevin]]'s screams so he walks faster, but he does not yet  know that his husband is there too.
> 

[[Falsair]] realizes that the energy of the rifts is the same energy as [[Kevin]]'s, and gets ready to act if [[Kevin]] makes a move. [[Kevin]] then reveals that the beige man on the other side of the rifts is his boss, [[Vinth]]. Again, he tries to get the briefcase from the Party so he can give it to [[Vinth]], who might be able to close the rifts. Then he moves to the middle of the room and starts pulsing with cold energy, causing the temperature to drop and the whole plane to flicker. 

Realizing the seriousness of the situation, [[Gal]] and [[Falsair]] decide to hand the briefcase over, and [[Meldohr]] proposes giving it to [[Vinth]] directly. While this exchange is happening, [[Evan]] throws another mug at a rift to see what happens, and they all watch as the mug is sheared in half when it impacts the edge of the rift, one side going through and the other flying past and exploding against the wall.

[[Nula]] takes the briefcase and walks into the closest rift. She tries to shout but is unable to get her friend's attention, so she goes to him and opens the briefcase, revealing a spinning metal orb. She throws at [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]], and it bounces off of him onto the ground. 

On the other side, [[Meldohr]] tries to talk to [[Kevin]], but he is too focused on concentrating energy. He tries to use [Dispel Magic](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dispel%20Magic#content) to stop what [[Kevin]] is doing but it has no effect on it. Suddenly, [[Kevin]]'s energy goes still, and the whole pub flickers into the astral plane. Everyone is now in the battlefield and [[Kevin]] yells out at [[Vinth]], warning him that the Party is the one that destroyed their base as his body falls apart.

>[!fail] Kevin is now dead.

### [Wannabe Machine World Overlords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAu-543810Y)

Now that the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] is closer to the [[Beep Boop|Beep Boops]], they can see that the bots are marked as "Mk B(x)" and that the one marked as Mk B1 looks slightly different, indicating that he is the leader of the formation.

[[Falsair]] tries to reason with [[Vinth]], but he is unwilling to listen and turns to fight the Party. Then, after creating some black squid tentacles to hold the bots down, [[Falsair]] fails to fight the pull of a nearby rift and gets sucked back into the pub. As he is pulled in, [[Vinth]] recognizes him.

> [!quote]
> <font color="grey">VINTH</font>: Falsair, how low you have fallen...

#BeigeStalkers As they fight, [[Evan]] is able to bridal carry the still unconscious [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] into another rift to get him to safety.

>[!fail] Back in the pub, Evan checks if Jeff is okay, but he no longer has a pulse.

The bots are very strong, and [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] is getting pummeled by them. Meanwhile, [[Meldohr]] unsuccessfully tries to reason with [[Vinth]] and explain that they had been manipulated into attacking their base by [[Beep Boop]]. 

At this point, [[Marius]] arrives at [[The Blue Bucket]]. He sees [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]], bleeding on the ground as the bots stand over him, and immediately moves to his side. As [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] sees him, he tells him to leave him behind and go, as at least one of them needs to stay alive to look after [[Marius#Relationships|Eudora]].

> <font color="grey">AERIS</font>: Marius, you need to leave. Just leave me here, you need to go.

> <font color="grey">MARIUS</font>: I'm not leaving, I'm never leaving you.

> <font color="grey">A</font>: It's better that one of us survives. We cannot both die here, you need to go back and make sure Eudora is safe. Everything we've built is compromised.

> <font color="grey">M</font>: Can't do it without you.
> 

On the other side of the battlefield, [[Nula]] is thrown back though the rift by [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]], who is very hurt and cannot hold on to the mammoth form any longer. [[Gal]] also walks through one of the rifts after collecting [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]]'s artifact from the ground.

### [He Is Dust in the Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH2w6Oxx0kQ)

While half of the Party is now back in the pub, the battle rages on. Alone against [[Vinth]] and the leader of the bots on his side of the battlefield, [[Meldohr]] is quickly taken down and goes unconscious, while [[Nula]] tries to heal her friend through the rifts.

Seeing [[Vinth]] near [[Meldohr]]'s unconscious form, the leader of the [[Beep Boop|Beep Boops]] shoots out two [Disintegrating rays](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Disintegrate#content), and manages to hit both of them.

> [!fail] The Party watches as both Vinth and Meldohr instantly turn to piles of fine gray dust, along with everything that they were carrying.

With [[Vinth]] gone, the rifts slowly start to shrink and close. 

Watching the rifts fall apart, [[Marius]] gives in and goes back into the rift after casting [Shield of Faith](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Shield%20of%20Faith#content) on his husband. Once [[Marius]] is out, [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] goes over to [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] and rolls him through another rift to get him to safety.

> [!quote]
> <font color="grey">MARIUS</font>: I know you will come back. If not for me, for Eudora.

The rifts finally close and the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] is back in [[The Blue Bucket]], along with [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]]'s dead body. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] is also there, unconscious, and will die soon if not healed.
