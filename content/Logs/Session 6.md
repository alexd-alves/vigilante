>[!note]  Wednesday evening.

The [[index#Players|Party]] gets on their way to [[The Blue Bucket]], planning on resting for the night before returning to confront [[Kevin]], even though they sent the [[Reset|beige people]] to drink there. [[Falsair]] is still being followed by the ==Chronal Book==.

As they arrive to [[The Blue Bucket]],they find the place very busy, as it is now a very popular place thanks to [[Gal]]'s Pub Quiz. [[Evan]] is inside, playing rollies and drinking with the [[Reset|beige people]]. [[Meldohr]] spends some time helping [[Paul (Bartender)]] while [[Falsair]] gets a free room key to go rest. [[Gal]] decides to share room with [[Falsair]] while [[Meldohr]] and [[Nula]] get their own rooms.

[[Falsair]] goes to his room while everyone else gathers at the Octopus table. [[Meldohr]] uses the pub's kitchen to make a stew, and he makes plans with [[Marius]] to cook breakfast and try to sell it in the morning.

>[!warning] [[Falsair]]
> While the rest makes the meal, [[Falsair]] spends some time in his room attuning to the Chronal Book. While he does not recover his ability to use magic yet, he learns of some perks of having the Book. He also learns that the Book is in an "Unawakened" state.
>

#MissingHeroes [[Meldohr]] also takes some stew up for [[Falsair]], along with some stale moldy bread (his favorite). Afterwards, while [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] and [[Evan]] have a cry and the others eat, [[Nula]] takes some time to check in on [[Marius]], and ask how he feels about his missing [[Marius#Thello Family|husband]].
[[Marius]] is worried about it, but he also thinks that [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] can look after himself. [[Nula]] think the same of [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]]. 

[[Meldohr]] also spends some time crafting a plaque out of the barrels in the pub, so that later he can engrave the Party's name on it and place it under the Octopus at their favorite table. He discusses with [[Gal]] briefly, but they agree on deciding on a name later.

Eventually everyone goes up to their rooms to rest, while [[Marius]] decides to go home, in case his husband returns. [[Gal]] and [[Meldohr]] spend some time getting familiar with their new items from Kevin's lab.

> [!note] Thursday morning. [[Marius]] is not present.

> [!warning] [[Evan]]
> In the morning, [[Evan]] wakes up in the booth downstairs, having slept there with [[Jeff]]. He notices "cracks" forming in the air inside the pub, sort of like tears or rifts in space, crackling and pulsating. He notices that the energy is similar as that of [[Kevin]]'s astral arms. 
> 
> [[Evan]] decides to shoot an arrow through one of the rifts, and watches it disappear in it and then fly out from a rift across the room. The energy begins to build around the front door as it slams open, revealing [[Kevin]].

#BeigeStalkers [[Kevin]] is screaming in agony, waking everyone up. Half of his body almost burnt off, his limbs on that side ripped off and replaced by the astral limbs.

> [!warning] [[Evan]]
> [[Kevin]] demands [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] and his artifact. Instead, [[Evan]] chooses to grab a mug and throw it into the rift, making it shoot out directly at [[Kevin]], but he is able to deflect it. [[Evan]] notices that using his energy to deflect the mug causes the rifts to open up further, the astral plane behind them becoming visible. In one of them a man in a beige suit is visible, as well as a tall elven man and a woolly mammoth, all fighting against a large formation of [[Beep Boop|Beep Boops]]. 
>
> [[Evan]] tries to get [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] to run upstairs and warn the others, but accidentally knocks him out instead. 
> 

Upstairs, everyone is awoken by the scream. [[Nula]] recognizes the screaming voice as [[Kevin]] and they get [[Gal]] and [[Falsair]]. ~~Meanwhile, [[Marius]] is chilling at home.~~ Going down to check on [[Evan]], [[Gal]] makes an entrance by sliding down the stairs. Everyone ~~except [[Marius]]~~ can now see [[Kevin]] and the rifts, as well as the people within them. 

#missingHeroes [[Nula]] recognizes the woolly mammoth as [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]]. He and his allies look weakened as they fight the army of [[Beep Boop|Beep Boops]]. They all recognize the elven man as [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]]. 

> [!warning] [[Marius]]
> Far, far away, [[Marius]] gets on his way to [[The Blue Bucket]] for breakfast with [[Meldohr]]. A few blocks away he can already hear [[Kevin]]'s screams so he walks faster, but he does not know that his husband is there.
> 

[[Falsair]] realizes that the energy of the rifts is the same energy as [[Kevin]]'s, and gets ready to act if [[Kevin]] makes a move. [[Kevin]] then reveals that the beige man on the other side of the rifts is his boss, [[Vinth]]. [[Kevin]] tries to get the briefcase from the Party so he can give it to [[Vinth]], who might be able to close the rifts. He then moves into the middle of the room and starts pulsing with cold energy, causing the temperature to drop and the whole plane to flicker. 

Realizing the seriousness of the situation, [[Gal]] and [[Falsair]] decide to hand the briefcase over, and [[Meldohr]] proposes giving it to [[Vinth]] directly. While this exchange is happening, [[Evan]] throws another mug at a rift to see what happens, and they all watch as the mug is sheared in half when it impacts the edge of the rift, one side going through and the other flying past and exploding against the wall.

[[Nula]] then takes the briefcase and walks into the closest rift.
