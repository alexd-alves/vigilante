> [!hint] TL;DR
> [[Marius]] is revived and learns that his ring has been destroyed. [[Wesley]] confirms that the elves are not the sea monster, but [[Falsair]] knows that they are taking the workers to sell them as slaves. The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] interrogates the remaining elf, [[Mack]], and they send him off to set up a meeting with a letter signed by [[Marius]] and sealed with the [[Bode Family]] seal after agreeing that he will help them and in exchange they will install him as the leader of the slave traders once their current leader, [[JC Gates]], is gone. 
> 
> On Friday morning, the [[Locations/index|Party]] goes to [[The Bloody Mammoth]] to meet [[Mack]] for breakfast. He brings questions from [[JC Gates]] in regards to whether [[Marius]] is Marius Bode and [[Falsair]] is the same [[Falsair]] they thought was dead. He tells them that [[JC Gates]] will meet them at his underwater base and they must figure out themselves how to breathe under the water. [[Marius]] lies at first, but then tells him that he is indeed Marius Bode, which angers [[Mack]].
> 
> As [[Mack]] has been instructed to follow them, the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] splits, one half taking [[Mack]] along for some shopping and the other heading to [[Jeff's Lab]] to collect the new communications device and ask him to make something to breathe under water.

> [!info] Thursday afternoon.

[[Marius]] is waking up as [[Gwyn]] is still picking through his clothes, while [[Lachlan]] is still grappling the remaining unconscious elf. He asks [[Gwyn]] to stop, and then notices his ring is gone. He asks where it is and [[Gal]] says [[Nula]] had it. [[Nula]] tells him that she had to make a quick decision to save him, while [[Falsair]] casts [Cure Wounds](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Cure%20Wounds#content) on him.

Then, [[Falsair]] calls out to [[Wesley]] and tells him to come out. He points at one of the sea elves and asks him whether that is the monster that has been taking workers. [[Wesley]] says that it looks like a person, not a monster. [[Gwyn]] suggests that they might look like fish when they are swimming, and [[Wesley]] suggests waking up the unconscious elf and throwing him in the water to check. [[Gwyn]] suggests dragging him into the warehouse instead to question him out of view.

### [Fishy Got Drip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai0xyY7_zA0)

[[Falsair]] checks the body of the unconscious elven wizard, finding a sword with a frost rune, as well as a spell book also covered in frost. He takes the book with him. The wizard is not wearing any armor, just some sort of waterproof material. Looking at his body, he also has a rune burned into his shoulder, the same as the Rapier. They find the same rapier on another body.

[[Gwyn]] searches one of the archers, finding the same type of fabric, some vials and an ornately crafted bow with the same rune as the others. He grabs the bow and the vials. They are three different shades of blue.

Meanwhile, [[Wesley]] manages to get a waterproof cloak off of one of the bodies, which he than manages to sell to [[Nula]] for 1 gold. They decide to interrogate the elf on the spot instead of taking him with them. [[Gwyn]] takes another three of the vials from the other archer.

### [Help Me Hide a Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4jPQw5nSIY)

To get rid of the bodies, they ask [[Lachlan]] to throw them in the water, and [[Gwyn]] asks [[Chicken]] to try eating them. However, [[Chicken]] only manages to chew up one of the hands before immediately regurgitating it.

Eventually, [[Chicken]] and [[Gwyn]] manage to throw the two bodies into the water, while [[Lachlan]] breaks a nearby box to see if they might be able to put the elves inside.

[[Lachlan]] bring the unconscious wizard inside and they close the warehouse door. [[Falsair]] heals him and tells [[Marius]] that he should lead the interrogation. [[Marius]] casts [Zone of Truth](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Zone%20of%20Truth#content).

### [Talk To Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41O9PO6Zw0)

First, [[Marius]] asks him what they were doing and why they attacked. After multiple attempts to persuade him, using the seal from the letter that [[Marius]] received from the [[Bode Family]] as well as whatever is under [[Marius]]'s sunglasses, the elf starts talking. He says that they were doing business in the docks and the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] got too close. Their business is to acquire goods and sell them on.

He demands information in exchange for revealing their business. [[Gal]] explains that they are not after them but the people taking the workers. She also tells him that they work for [[Beep Boop]] and he wants to know who is taking the workers. The elf says that he should already know. He tells the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] that he reports to someone called "J". [[Falsair]] remembers a group of elves involved in the slave trade, led by a [[JC Gates]]. He reveals that this is where the dock workers are going, to be sold on as slaves.

The elf's name is [[Mack]]. [[Falsair]] messages [[Marius]], saying they should see if there is a deal they can make with [[Mack]]. [[Marius]] suggests making an agreement, letting [[Mack]] go unharmed in exchange for guarantees that he will stick to the deal. [[Mack]] thinks that he is dead anyways if his buddies find out, so [[Marius]] suggests faking his death. He agrees to talk, and says that his team is maybe 70 to 80 people. Headquarters are under the warehouse, the only entrance being the door under the water. The door only allows sea elves through though, and afterwards there are multiple submerged locks. There are different parts within the underground building, hideouts, research offices, an are where the goods are kept... It is 20-30 feet down under the water. They also use gadgets to allow the "goods" to breath, which also serve the purpose of killing them if they try to escape.

He is willing to provide those to the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]]. [[Falsair]] asks when the next shipment of slaves is. They usually move 30-40 slaves around at a time, to avoid being spotted. [[Falsair]] asks [[Mack]] whether [[JC Gates]] would be willing to speak to them. He says that it is not impossible, and the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] suggests giving him a letter and sending him alive as a message.

Before discussing further, [[Mack]] tells them that there is an [Arcane Eye](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Arcane%20Eye#content) watching the door from the river, and suggests checking whether it is currently in use. [[Gwyn]] also messages [[Marius]], telling him to be careful using the [[Bode Family]] name, as they will probably hear that he is using him for his own purposes.

[[Mack]] agrees to help them if they install him in place of [[JC Gates]] as the leader of the slavers. [[Marius]] writes him the letter, signing it as his brother [[Saeto]]. He is unable to make the signature look good, so finally he signs it as himself and seals it using the wax seal from the original letter. They also ask [[Mack]] whether they would have an invitation to the Black Market Auction. They agree to meet at [[The Bloody Mammoth]] for breakfast with an answer from [[JC Gates]].

### [Raise Your Cups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHNe-S_UVs8)

They leave him with the letter and head to [[The Blue Bucket]]. [[Falsair]] lags behind to find [[Darren]]. He is still carrying boxes as usual, and [[Falsair]] stops to have a brief conversation with him, saying that his story resonated with him.

The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] makes their way to the pub. It is all shut down, with a sign that says closed on the door. [[Paul]] is inside, sweeping up all the broken stuff left over from the earlier battle. [[Gal]] apologizes and offers to help him clean.

[[Gwyn]] takes [[Chicken]] upstairs to [[Meldohr]]'s room, where he will be staying. [[Paul]] asks about [[Meldohr]], and tells him that he was his favorite and he had helped a lot. [[Gal]] tells him that he is dead.

>[!quote]
><font color="grey">GAL:</font> He's fucking dead, mate.

>[!warning] Everyone except Gwyn
>[[Marius]] tells the rest that they need to be aware that he is not currently friendly with the rest of the [[Bode Family]]. He reveals the rest of the letter, which was a direct threat to him and his new family, and an acknowledgment that the [[Bode Family]] are aware of his employment at [[Barouk's Works]]. He says that he will let the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] know if he receives any more letters.
>
>They tell [[Lachlan]] that they don't really like [[Beep Boop]], and that [[Fengar]] is dead, which is not public knowledge. [[Falsair]] notes that it doesn't matter if he tells anyone, as no one will believe that [[Beep Boop]] is evil.
>a
>[[Falsair]] takes some time to try to work out if he can learn any of the spells on the elf's book, but there is not much there as most of his magic was to do with his blade singing technique. He also wants to visit a blacksmith. The two blacksmith's in the area are [[Aegis's Arsenal]] and [[Sphinx's Riddle]], but he is going to wait for [[Gal]] to identify the magic items they took. The Rapiers are [Frost Brand Rapiers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4900-frost-brand-rapier), and the cloak is a [Manta Ray Cloak](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Cloak%20of%20the%20Manta%20Ray#content). [[Falsair]] hands one of the rapiers to [[Lachlan]].
>a
>They stay and help [[Paul]] clean up everything. The air within the pub still feels weird due to the earlier rifts. [[Paul]] pours them all a pint of ale to clink to [[Meldohr]], and pours an extra one on the ground.
>a
>[[Nula]] gets a message from [[Jeff]]'s Sending Stone, saying that he had finished working on the stones and had made a cool item that would allow them to stay in touch with each other permanently. He is considering producing more to sell through [[Gal]]'s business. The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] will stop by the next they to collect the item after breakfast with [[Mack]] at [[The Bloody Mammoth]].

>[!info] Friday morning (6 days to the auction).

[[Nula]] and [[Marius]] meet downstairs first. [[Marius]] thanks her, and reminds her to find a diamond in case it happens again. He wants to wait for [[Aeris]] before replacing the ring.

### [The Rat Free Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLGeDwhsZkY)

They all make their way to [[The Bloody Mammoth]]. The building is nice outside, made of wood and turning a bit yellow in places, maybe from the chemicals used by fumigation services. There is a middle aged human behind the bar, very thin with grey long hair. As they come in, he perks up and offers them a table. There are no other customers inside. [[Nula]] asks him if he knows [[Paul]] the bartender, but he seems cagey about it.

[[Lachlan]] asks for a full breakfast and several types of tea. [[Gal]] asks for jasmine tea, [[Marius]] for peppermint tea, and [[Nula]] for rainbow tea. [[Gwyn]] asks for ale. The bartender's name is [[Luke]]. He asks what rainbow tea is, and [[Nula]] tells him that it is just surprise tea. They also request that he puts a bell on the door.

After around 15 minutes, [[Luke]] comes back with all the items. They are all amazing. As the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] eats, another hour goes by and they start getting worried that [[Mack]] isn't coming. They decide to wait another hour. After around an hour and a half, the bell on the door rings, and [[Mack]] walks in. He is in the same clothes, but has a new sword.

He pulls up a chair and sits at the table. He has delivered the letter, which specifically said that he [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] needs to set up a meeting with [[JC Gates]] to discuss urgent business, and that if he cannot facilitate the meeting they will find other ways to get to him. [[Mack]] offers [[Marius]] a chance to cast [Zone of Truth](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Zone%20of%20Truth#content) again, which he does, and [[Mack]] chooses to fail against it. He says that he gave [[JC Gates]] their descriptions, and that he was asked to come back and ask [[Marius]] to clarify if he is, indeed, Marius Bode. [[Marius]] lies, and says that he is not Marius Bode, but that he occasionally uses his name and appearance. He also asks about the "supposedly dead" [[Falsair]], to which he responds that death is just a condition that can be overcome.

[[Mack]] then says that [[JC Gates]] has agreed to meet and discuss the procurement of goods. He also told him that the [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] are working for [[Beep Boop]]. Off the record, he says that [[JC Gates]] will find a way to confirm that himself. He wants to have the meeting tonight and in a location preferable to him, his base, where [[Mack]] will take them. They have the rest of the day to figure out how they will breathe underwater.

[[Mack]] is to stay with them until the meeting. He will then pass the information on to [[JC Gates]] before they meet. [[Marius]] decides to walk back and say that he is actually Marius Bode. [[Mack]] is very upset that he has lied while he has been forthcoming.

The [[Characters/Players/index|Party]] chooses to split, forcing [[Mack]] to pick which half he wants to follow. [[Marius]], [[Falsair]] and [[Gal]] (The Couchcil) go to the shops, while [[Nula]], [[Gwyn]] and [[Lachlan]] (Team Lab) go pick up the stones from [[Jeff's Lab]], hoping that [[Mack]] won't follow them. [[Mack]] decides to go with [[Marius]].

>[!warning] Team Lab (Nula, Gwyn and Lachlan)
> The three make their way to [[Jeff's Lab]]. There, [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] explains that he has turned the stones into a set of six bangles that are all connected and can communicate across unlimited distances as long as they remain within the same plane. The bangles only have one channel, meaning that everyone wearing them hears everything.
> 
> [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] also agrees on working on some device to allow them to breathe under water for up to an hour. However, he needs to buy material which will cost 100 gold. Between the three, they manage to gather 58 gold pieces to give him, so they still owe him 42.
> 
> [[Lachlan]] also asks him to do something with the Rapier to allow him to adapt it to his own abilities.
