*19/11/2023*

It is Wednesday.

The [[index#Players|Party]] is in the HR office at [[Barouk's Works]]. ==[[Nula]] has a file on [[Marius]] that she took out of the broken drawer. [[Evan]] is in the building, and sees [[Barouk's Works|Karen]] leave the building in tears.==

To make sure that no one enters the office while the rest look through the drawers, [[Falsair]] disguises himself as [[Barouk's Works|Karen]] and stands guard outside of the door. ==While he is outside, [[Evan]] almost kills him by startling him to ask where the rest are.==

Once inside, [[Marius]] asks [[Evan]] what where he has been, and he responds outside and "birds". He seems very rattled and dirty, so he rests on [[Barouk's Works|Karen]]'s chair while [[Marius]] goes find [[Barouk's Works|Jenny from Finance]].

[[Meldohr|Meldohr]] finds the key to the office's door and locks it behind [[Marius]] and [[Falsair]]. Hearing the lock, [[Falsair]] leaves to go find his cats and explore the building. He successfully makes a call and finds one of his cats locked in a broom cupboard upstairs. He commands it to find the sabre-tooth tiger Daddy and the rest of the cats.

Meanwhile, [[Marius]] has also walked upstairs and sees [[Falsair]] return, still disguised as [[Barouk's Works|Karen]]. He goes to reception to find the pigeon holes where mail is kept. His own pigeon hole is empty, and as he places a note in his husband's he notices that the last note he left has gone uncollected. He then makes his way back to the rest of the [[index#Players|Party]].
### [Rattle That Lock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1v7hXEQhsQ)

Back in the HR office, [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] and [[Gal|Gal]] start trying keys in the locks. [[Nula]] pulls out [[Marius]]'s file and, concerned that it is an invasion of privacy, she gives it to [[Evan]] while the rest peek over his shoulder.

The file is labelled as "[[Marius]] Bode", a name that [[Gal|Gal]] recognises from [[Falsair]]'s stories. It is the name of a family known among villains as a sort of "mafia" family that dedicates itself to manipulating the world around them to stay on top. They are linked to Clockwork Sorcery. 

The file has been amended to show [[Marius]]'s current last name which is Thello, like his husband [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]]. [[Marius]]'s family ties are listed as his husband and daughter, but also the [[Marius#Bode Family|Bode family]], listing [[Marius]] as the youngest child. According to the file, [[Marius]] was involved in villainous activities along his family for a while in matters related to magical items, until he was thwarted by [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] and switched over to the hero side.

As they finish reading the file, [[Falsair]] is let back in by [[Gal|Gal]], who immediately tells him about [[Marius]]'s backstory. [[Falsair]] recognises [[Marius#Bode Family|Siri]] and [[Marius#Bode Family|Loris]] as the parents which he has met at some point. They decide not to tell [[Marius]] that they have read the file when he returns.

[[Evan]] is now awake, and [[Falsair]] uses his magic to command him to open all the drawers quickly as [[Marius]] comes back in. [[Nula]] hands him the file and tells him that they did not read it, but [[Marius]] is very nervous about it. [[Gal|Gal]] remarks that Bode is an interesting name but [[Marius]] does not respond to it.

As [[Evan]] is opening the cabinets, [[Nula]] looks for [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]]'s file ==and notices [[Evan]] taking his own file out and hiding it.== In [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]]'s file, she notices that she is not listed as a family tie. [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] has been working for [[Barouk's Works]] for a long time, and was part of the founding team. The most recent job listed is redacted. [[Nula]] tries to scratch off the substance used to redact and finds a few words but also scratches some of the paper off. The title is "Hidden...".

[[Nula]] then asks [[Marius]] to look at [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]]'s file to see if the last job matches, but [[Marius]] refuses as he does not want to look at his husband's confidential information.

While they discuss, [[Evan]] looks to see if there are files for [[Benny]], [[Beep Boop]] or [[Issha]] but finds nothing. However, there is a file on [[Ensari]]. She is described in it as a tall (6.5 ft) elven woman, and is listed as the owner of [[Barouk's Works]] and member of the founding team. She does not seem to do anything beyond running the business, but there is a last job listed which is also redacted. [[Nula]] tries to scratch it but accidentally destroys the paper.

[[Marius]] allows [[Gal|Gal]] to look at [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]]'s file. [[Nula]] recognises him as one of the people she saw in her [[Session 3#[Making Their Way Downtown](https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwkej79U3ek)|vision]], but he was not the one who looked hurt. [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] thinks that [[Ensari]] works in the same team as [[Marius#Thello Family|Aeris]] and [[Nula#Relationships|Aric]] even though [[Nula]] did not recognise her. The file also lists all of his jobs as completed, including a mission to infiltrate a [[Marius#Bode Family|Bode]] deal.

[[Nula]] manages to scratch the redacted last mission in his file. The title reads "*Hidden Plot in Justice*". It is dated 11 days ago.

The [[index#Players|Party]] agree that it is likely that [[Ensari]] and her team's mission is related to the [[Beep Boop]] [[Session 2|incident]], and that the files might have been redacted because of concerns of a mole in [[Barouk's Works]], which would be justified as [[Issha]] is compromised.

[[Gal|Gal]] also tries to take [[Evan]]'s file but it is gone, and once again [[Evan]] runs away.

[[Meldohr|Meldohr]] finds [[Falsair]]'s file and his own, which he gives to [[Gal|Gal]]. [[Falsair]]'s is too large to attempt to read so they leave it.

==Meanwhile, [[Evan]] is running through the building, searching for someone. After barging into multiple empty meeting rooms, he eventually finds one with a person sitting inside on a table. It is [[Jeff Fishkin]]. [[Evan]] asks him if the birds are following him too but [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] tells him that it is the beige people that are looking for him. [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] is terrified of them. [[Evan]] then distracts him and escapes the room unseen.==
### [Getting Back On Track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlmpIRFeI8I)

Once [[Evan]] is gone, [[Falsair]] and [[Marius]] fix up the office and they all go find [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]]. As they arrive to the meeting room, they see [[Evan]] sneaking out. He tells them that [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] really likes the color beige.

They all walk in, [[Evan]] coming in last. [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] is wearing a white lab coat and is carrying a briefcase. [[Gal|Gal]] introduces the party and [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] asks them to take him to his office. He has been receiving threatening messages in his sleep and keeps seeing people in beige suits. He also reveals that what the beige people are looking for is his briefcase and the magical artefact within. [[Evan]] tries to take the briefcase but [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] snatches it away.

The item was created to duplicate the magical source within a person to allow them to do powerful magic without being harmed by it. [[Gal|Gal]] shows him her drawing of the panels from [[Beep Boop]]'s secret lab in [[Fenny's Home]], but he does not recognise that specific machine. [[Nula]] also asks him whether the artefact requires a blue chemical and if he recognises the phrase "[[Session 2|abducted wild shape sequence]]" but he does not know anything. ==[[Falsair]] tells [[Evan]] that they should take the briefcase.==

[[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] then explains that he took the artefact out of the office as he was worried that it might explode as it is a very experimental piece of equipment. He does not work for anyone in particular, but he receives money from different organisations for research purposes. [[Gal|Gal]] offers him a job with her, where he would not be at risk.
### [The Battle of the Three Jeffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdfGreUJSqw)

To move [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] to his office safely, [[Falsair]] and [[Evan]] disguise themselves as [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]]. [[Evan]] manages to grab the real briefcase with only [[Nula]] and [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] noticing. [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] asks [[Evan]] whether he thinks it is safe if he is being chased by birds, but [[Evan]] is confident that they will not recognise him with his disguise. [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] also tries to use [Dispel Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic) on [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]], in case the beige people are hallucinations caused by some form of magic.

The [[index#Players|Party]] then leaves [[Barouk's Works]] in formation to protect [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] on the way to the office. [[Marius]] tries to spot any celestials, fiends or undead nearby but does not notice anything. [[Nula]] does spot 5 robins flying 70 or 80 ft above them, but when [[Falsair]] tries to message them there is no answer. As they turn a corner, they are gone.

Once they arrive to [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]]'s office they look inside. There are stairs and a corridor that force them to go in a single file, with the Jeffs in the middle, and [[Nula]] leading.

As they get to the room that is the actual office, they see a chair in the middle of the room and machinery around the walls. There is a huge lit kiln on the right side and steel desks in the back corner. As [[Nula]] enters while the rest wait in the corridor, the chair swivels around revealing an [Aarakocra](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/4-aarakocra) man sitting in it. He demands to see [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] and says that he is a colleague of his.

[[Nula]] returns and asks [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] if he knows the bird man. He says that he does work in a team with [[Kevin]] who is an [Aarakocra](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/4-aarakocra), but they are not sure whether that was the real [[Kevin]].

[[Evan]] then goes talk to [[Kevin]] with [[Nula]] while the real [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] waits outside with [[Falsair]] to feed him answers, but [[Kevin]] immediately sees past the disguise. Meanwhile, [[Marius]] places [[Gal|Gal]]'s Glorious Goods logo on the briefcase, and she booby traps it in case [[Kevin]] manages to take it. [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] also casts [Death Ward]() on the real [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]].

[[Nula]] tries to look into [[Kevin]]'s thoughts but he resists it. She then asks him if he is [[Kevin]], and he answers that he is but maybe not the Kevin that they are thinking of. She also asks why he wants the artefacts and who he works for which angers him, and as he begins to step towards the [[index#Players|Party]] five other people appear in the room, all dressed in beige suits.

Seeing this, [[Falsair]] pushes the real [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] back towards [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] and [[Marius]] and comes in to talk to [[Kevin]]. He convinces him that he has hidden the briefcase in an alleyway near the [[Justice]] building. [[Kevin]] intends to drag him there to find it, and spectral arms begin to appear around him, illuminating the room. The beige people behind him are two gnomes, two elves and a dwarf, and with the light around him some machinery in the room becomes visible too. There are two sets of handwheels at the back of the room and a pair of coats that can be worn as protection into the kiln.

[[Evan]] quickly takes the two elves down, and [[Nula]] attempts to [Entangle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/entangle) [[Kevin]]. She fails but manages to catch both gnomes, and [[Falsair]] then creates [Black Tentacles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/black-tentacles) around them. [[Marius]] also pushes past [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] into the room, casting [Sanctuary](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sanctuary) on him, and throws a javelin at [[Kevin]], who catches it and throws it back.

Having seen his friends die, the beige dwarf runs to one of the handwheels on the corner of the room and turns it to raise a panel in the door. He crawls under it and disappears. As he vanishes beyond it, [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] places [[Gal|Gal]] on his shoulders and charges past [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]], slamming into [[Marius]] and causing the three of them to fall to the ground.

Inside the lab, [[Falsair]] is pummeled into unconsciousness by [[Kevin]], who then goes after [[Nula]]. [[Gal|Gal]] is able to get out of the corridor and launches a Thunder [Chaos Bolt](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:chaos-bolt) at [[Kevin]]. She tries to help [[Falsair]] up but fails.

[[Evan]] is then able to kill one of the remaining gnomes, and [[Nula]] manages to attack [[Kevin]]. However, as he is hit, he disintegrates into energy and vanishes.
### [Should We Stay or Should We Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMaE6toi4mk)

As [[Marius]] and [[Meldohr|Meldohr]] get [[Falsair]] up, [[Gal|Gal]] gets the remaining gnome to surrender and talk. He is called Brian, and he explains that what they saw was [[Kevin]]'s astral projection, and that he is most likely back in his office. The two ways into the office are through the panel on the wall or through teleportation circles that can be found in the black market under the city. [[Gal|Gal]] offers him a new job.

[[Meldohr|Meldohr]] finds some precious metal dust inside the kiln while [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] tells the rest that he did not know that there was a panel there and that he thought that the handwheels were broken controls for the previous kiln.

[[Marius]] tries to whisper to [[Falsair]] that he saw an R symbol on the beige suits and that it belongs to a team called [[Reset]]. ==He remembers that a member of the [[Marius#Bode Family|Bode Family]] wore a beige suit on the one occasion they had met and had the same symbol. [[Falsair]] does not know much about [[Reset]] but he recognises it as an offshoot of the [[Marius#Bode Family|Bode Family]].== 

[[Evan]] searches the bodies of the dead henchmen and finds some healing potions on them.

Some concerns are raised in regards to the scope of the mission, but eventually the [[index#Players|Party]] decides to chase [[Kevin]] into his office without resting, even though [[Nula]] knows that his real body will be unharmed. However, if they follow, he might not have time to prepare for a confrontation. Before they go ahead, [[Falsair]] raises the three dead henchmen as zombies.
