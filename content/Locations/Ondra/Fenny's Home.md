Located in the [[Ondra#Locations|Barouk District]] within [[Ondra]], across the street from [[Miss Lucy's Home]].

It is an unremarkable Tudor style house, with doors and gardens at the front and back.

The [[index#Players and Characters|party]] broke in to find [[Miss Lucy]]'s 24 cats, but found the house empty. However, there was a large amount of cat-adjacent fur in the bedroom, later revealed to be most likely [[Fengar]]'s fur, while the rest of the house seemed uninhabited. 

There was a very large metal portrait of [[Beep Boop]] in the living room, covering the entrance to a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, the party found [[Beep Boop]]'s [[Session 2|secret lab]].
