Office where [[Jeff Fishkin]] works on magical artefact.

The team encountered [[Kevin]] and the [[Reset]] beige henchmen here while on a [[Session 4#[The Battle of the Three Jeffs](https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdfGreUJSqw)|mission]] to escort [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] to his office. The handwheels at the back of the room open a panel, leading to [[Kevin]]'s office.

After defeating the [[Reset|henchmen]] and [[Kevin]]'s projection, [[Jeff Fishkin|Jeff]] promises the [[index#Players|Party]] that they can use the lab once they have defeated [[Kevin]].
