Located in the [[Ondra#Locations|Barouk District]] of [[Ondra]]. [[Miss Lucy]] lives here with her 24 cats.

The place is made of thatch and other plant material. The garden is covered in plants that don't normally grow together and the place stinks of mud. All the houses around it are Tudor style houses.

The cottage's windows are no longer visible as they are covered with vegetation and the walls are covered in cat scratches.

It sits across the street from [[Fenny's Home]].
