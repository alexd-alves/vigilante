Beep Boop is a robot-looking being, known as one of [[Ondra]]'s "[[Ondra#Superheroes|Superheroes]]". He was created by fellow Superhero [[Benny]], alongside six sentries that look identical and each specialize in different skills. They are designated Mk 1-6.

A very large portrait of him with red eyes was used to cover the tunnel entrance in [[Fenny's Home]], which led to a secret lab. Two smaller portraits were present within the lab.

After the [[Session 2|lab incident]], Beep Boop met the [[index#Players and Characters|party]] at the agency's building. He was very upset over the damage caused to his lab and told the party that they had destroyed a valuable resource, and that going forward they would do jobs for him or stay out of his way or be destroyed. He then ordered the party to leave and was left alone with [[Issha]].

==Before the rest of the party joined this conversation, Beep Boop revealed to [[Evan]] that he was able to watch the party's actions through this portrait, as well as the smaller portraits in the lab.== [[Evan]] and [[Nula]] also noticed an engraving on Beep Boop's neck that read "Mk 7", which is strange as no Beep Boop copies are known to exist beyond Mk 6.

During the [[Session 6|bot fight]] at [[The Blue Bucket]], the [[index#Players|Party]] encounters a series of Beep Boop copies marked "Mk B"
