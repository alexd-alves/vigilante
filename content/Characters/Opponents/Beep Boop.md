| ---- | ---- |
| [[Session 6]] | #MissingHeroes #BeigeStalkers #EvilBoop The Party find [[Reset]] leader [[Vinth]], Aeris and Aric fighting together against a formation of Beep Boop copies. These copies are marked "Mk B(x)", the leader being Mk B1. They also realize that [[Beep Boop]] had manipulated them into killing [[Vinth]] for him. |
| [[Session 4]] | #MissingHeroes #EvilBoop While searching for information on Aric and Aeris at [[Barouk's Works]]'s HR department, [[Evan]] is unable to find any files relating to Beep Boop. After discovering from the HR files that [[Ensari]], Aric and Aeris are on a mission related to [[Justice]], the Party believes that this is related to the destruction of the lab in [[Fenny's Home]]. They also believe that the HR files might have been redacted to protect them from a mole in [[Barouk's Works]], potentially [[Issha]], who might be under Beep Boop's control. |
| [[Session 3]] | #BeigeStalkers #EvilBoop When the Party returns to [[Barouk's Works]] and is given their new task by [[Issha]], [[Meldohr]] notices that he has a device in his right eye, similar to the cameras in the eyes of the Beep Boop portraits that they had found in [[Fenny's Home]] |
| [[Session 1]] | #MissLucysCats #EvilBoop After the battle in [[Fenny's Home]], the Party returns to [[Barouk's Works]] to find a very angry Beep Boop. He tells the Party that they have destroyed a very valuable resource, and that if they do not want to be destroyed themselves they will continue to work at [[Barouk's Works]] and do dirty work for him. Afterwards, [[Issha]] is left alone with him. Beep Boop also reveal to [[Evan]] that he was able to watch the Party's actions through the eyes in the portraits at [[Fenny's Home]], and he and [[Nula]] notice that the engraving on Beep Boop's neck reads "Mk 7". This is strange, as there are no known copies of Beep Boop beyond Mk 6. |
| [[Session 1]] | #MissLucysCats #EvilBoop While looking for [[Miss Lucy]]'s cats, the Party finds a massive portrait of Beep Boop in [[Fenny's Home]], hanging from the living room wall. [[Meldohr]] and [[Nula]] manage to pull it down, revealing the entrance to a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, they find a secret lab and [[Fengar]], unconscious and connected to a series of machines and vats of chemicals. |
