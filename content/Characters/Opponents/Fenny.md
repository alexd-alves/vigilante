Suspected to be the same person as [[Fengar]].

He lived in [[Fenny's Home]], across from [[Miss Lucy]], who suspected him of having kidnapped her cats.

Neither Miss Lucy nor her neighbours were able to provide a description beyond "asshole". He was known to yell at people in the street near his house.
