| [[Session 3]] | The Party convinces [[Karen]] that [[Jenny]] has been talking behind her back and saying that she has some sort of relationship with [[Jonathan]] the cleaner, and that she should go take revenge so she leaves her office. [[Gal]] sells her a stink bomb, which [[Karen]] throws into [[Jenny]]'s finance office. Later, [[Falsair]] convinces her that she should go home as she is very upset thinking about the consequences of her actions. |
