| [[Session 2]] | #MissLucysCats #EvilBoop  [[Nula]] identifies the unconscious man in [[Fenny's Home]] as Fengar. He is surrounded by containers that are pumping a bright blue liquid into him. During combat, Fengar wakes up and begs [[Gal]] to mercy kill him, so she severs the tubes connecting him to the vats causing the liquid and his blood to spill everywhere. Once out of combat, observing that he is now dead, [[Meldohr]] figures out that the blue liquid is forcing the magic within his body to activate, while his blood is being removed so that this magic can be used outside of him. After the room is set on fire, Meldohr attempts and fails to recover his body. |
