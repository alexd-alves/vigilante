Suspected to be the same person as [[Fenny]].

Fengar was one of [[Ondra]]'s most known [[Ondra#Superheroes|Superheroes]]. He was a Druid and could Wild Shape into a Saber-Toothed Tiger.

He was found by the party in [[Beep Boop]]'s secret lab within [[Fenny's Home]]. He is seemingly unconscious on a hospital bed and is surrounded by large containers of blue chemicals which are being pumped into him. 

He woke up and begged to be put down, and then died during the encounter at the lab. His dead body was left there.
